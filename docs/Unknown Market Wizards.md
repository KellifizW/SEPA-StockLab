# Preface

# THE	premise	I	had	when	I	set	out	to	write	 Unknown	Market	Wizards 	was	that

there	 were	 solo	 traders,	 operating	 in	 complete	 obscurity,	 who	 were	 achieving
performance	 results	 that	 far	 surpassed	 the	 vast	 majority	 of	 professional	 asset
managers.	 I	 found	 these	 traders	 and	 proved	 my	 premise.	 But	 I	 also	 found
something	else	that	amazed	me.

I	never	thought	I	would	again	find	traders	whose	records	matched	those	of	some
of	 the	 traders	 in	 the	 first	 _Market	Wizards_ book.	 I	 assumed	 the	 extraordinary
performance	 achieved	 by	 some	 of	 those	 traders,	 while	 a	 testament	 to	 their
exceptional	trading	skill,	was	partially	made	possible	by	the	unique	markets	of
the	 inflationary	 1970s.	 Moreover,	 the	 ensuing	 decades	 witnessed	 enormous
growth	in	the	application	of	quantitative	power	to	trading	and	investing,	with
professional	 managers	 accounting	 for	 an	 ever-increasing	 percentage	 of	 all
trading—trends	that	suggested	it	would	be	far	more	difficult	for	traders	to	excel
by	wide	margins	in	today’s	markets.

To	my	great	surprise,	some	of	the	traders	I	found	in	writing	 _Unknown	Market
Wizards_ 	may	well	have	the	best	performance	records	I	have	ever	encountered.

The	opening	sentence	of	the	preface	to	the	first	 _Market	Wizards_ 	book,	written


over	 30	 years	 ago—“There	 are	 some	 amazing	 stories	 here”—seems	 entirely
appropriate	to	this	volume	as	well.	Here	are	the	remarkable	traders	you	will	meet
in	 _Unknown	Market	Wizards_ :

```
A	college	graduate	who	started	with	a	$2,500	account	and	in	the	course	of
the	next	17	years	pulled	$50	million	of	profits	out	of	the	market.
An	 ex-advertising	 executive	 who	 in	 a	 27-year	 career	 as	 a	 futures	 trader
achieved	an	average	annual	return	of	58%.
A	 stock	 trader	 who	 developed	 a	 unique	 trading	 approach	 that	 utilizes
neither	fundamental	nor	technical	analysis	and	turned	his	original	$83,
stake	into	$21	million.
A	futures	trader	who	over	a	13-year	career	has	averaged	337%	per	year
without	any	drawdowns	exceeding	10%	after	his	first	trading	year.
A	 bellhop	 in	 the	 Czech	 Republic	 whose	 day	 trading	 strategy	 for	 buying
stocks	has	provided	return/risk	performance	that	far	surpassed	over	99%	of
both	long-only	funds	and	hedge	funds.
A	 futures	 trader	 who	 made	 and	 lost	 over	 one-half	 million	 dollars	 twice
before	developing	a	contrarian	methodology	that	led	to	a	20-year	career	of
consistent	trading	success.
A	former	US	marine	who	designed	proprietary	software	to	automatically
trade	 market	 events	 and	 has	 a	 10-year	 record	 of	 outstanding	 return/risk
performance.
A	futures	trader	who	has	averaged	a	return	of	280%	per	year	with	an	end-
of-month	maximum	drawdown	of	only	11%.
A	music	major	who	used	his	self-taught	programming	skills	to	design	stock
trading	systems	that	delivered	an	average	return	of	20%	during	the	past	
years,	well	over	triple	the	S&P	500	return	during	the	same	period.
A	one-time	professional	tennis	aspirant	who	achieved	a	remarkable	average
annual	return	of	298%	over	a	near-decade	as	a	futures	trader.
An	equity	trader	who	by	combining	long	investment	positions	with	short-
term	event	trading	has	tripled	the	S&P	500	performance	in	both	return	and
return/risk	terms.
```
If	you	are	expecting	to	find	step-by-step	instructions	on	how	to	make	100%	a
year	in	the	markets	with	only	two	hours	of	work	a	week,	quick,	put	this	book


down—you’ve	got	the	wrong	book!

If,	however,	you	are	looking	to	learn	from	some	of	the	world’s	best	traders—
how	they	think	about	markets;	what	they	have	learned	about	trading;	how	they
have	improved;	what	mistakes	they	have	learned	to	avoid;	what	advice	they	have
for	other	traders—you	will	find	much	here	that	is	instructive.


# Acknowledgments

The	 first	 step	 in	 writing	 a	 _Market	 Wizards_ book	 is	 identifying	 exceptional
traders.	In	this	regard,	two	individuals	were	extremely	helpful.	Steve	Goldstein,
Managing	Director	of	Alpha	R	Cubed,	a	London-based	coaching	firm,	was	the
source	for	two	of	the	traders	included	in	this	book	and	several	others	who	might
appear	in	a	follow-up	volume	(if	there	is	one).	Mark	Ritchie,	an	excellent	trader
in	his	own	right,	recommended	two	other	of	the	included	traders.	Ironically,	I
had	intended	to	interview	Mark	himself,	but	the	text	I	completed	reached	book-
length	before	I	scheduled	the	trip.	Perhaps	he	will	appear	in	a	future	volume.
Posthumous	 thanks	 go	 to	 Bill	 Dodge,	 who	 brought	 Jason	 Shapiro	 to	 my
attention.

FundSeeder.com	(a	website	created	by	FundSeeder	Technologies,	a	company	I
am	affiliated	with)	was	the	source	of	three	of	the	traders	in	this	volume.	I	also
used	 FundSeeder.com	 analytics	 to	 calculate	 all	 the	 performance	 statistics
referenced	in	this	book.

I	am	grateful	to	my	wife,	Jo	Ann,	who,	as	in	all	previous	 _Market	Wizards_ 	books,
provided	an	invaluable	sounding	board	and	offered	constructive	criticism	where
appropriate—advice	that	I	always	followed.

Of	 course,	 there	 would	 be	 no	 book	 without	 the	 willingness	 of	 the	 traders
interviewed	 to	 participate	 and	 openly	 share	 their	 experience,	 wisdom,	 and
insights.	They	provided	me	with	great	material	to	work	with.

Thanks	to	Marc	Niaufre,	who	proofed	all	the	chapters	and	managed	to	find	typos
that	had	eluded	me	despite	multiple	readings.

Finally,	I	would	like	to	thank	my	editor	at	Harriman	House,	Craig	Pearce,	who
made	 the	 final	 step	 of	 bringing	 my	 manuscript	 into	 polished	 form	 a	 pleasure
rather	than	a	chore.	He	struck	the	perfect	balance	between	offering	revisions	that
improved	the	text	and	avoiding	unnecessary	changes.


# Part	I:	Futures	Traders


_Note:_ 	Readers	unfamiliar	with	the	futures	market	may	find	it	helpful	to	first
read	the	short	primer	provided	in	Appendix	1.


# Peter	Brandt: 	Strong	Opinions,	Weakly	Held

# IT	is	remarkable	how	many	of	the	Market	Wizards	that	I	have	interviewed	failed

in	 their	 initial	 trading	 endeavor—some	 multiple	 times.	 In	 this	 respect,	 Peter
Brandt	fits	the	bill.	What	is	unusual	about	Brandt,	though,	is	that	after	well	over
a	decade	of	spectacular	success	following	his	initial	failed	attempts,	he	lost	his
edge,	went	cold	turkey	on	trading	for	11	years,	and	then	resumed	trading	for	a
second	lengthy	span	of	outstanding	performance.

Brandt	is	definitely	old	school.	His	trading	is	based	on	classical	chart	analysis
that	 traces	 its	 origins	 to	 Richard	 Schabacker’s	 book,	 _Technical	 Analysis	 and
Stock	Market	Profits_ ,	published	in	1932,	and	later	popularized	by	Edwards	and
Magee’s,	 _Technical	Analysis	of	Stock	Trends_ ,	published	in	1948.

He	started	his	financial	career	as	a	commodities	broker	in	the	early	1970s,	just
when	spiking	inflation	and	soaring	commodity	prices	transformed	commodities
from	a	financial	backwater	to	the	hot	new	market.	Back	then,	the	futures	markets
were	 called	 _commodities_ because	 all	 the	 futures	 markets	 were	 indeed	 just
commodities.	 This	 period	 was	 the	 threshold	 of	 the	 introduction	 of	 financial
futures	in	currencies,	interest	rates,	and	stock	indexes,	which	would	become	the
dominant	 futures	 markets,	 making	 commodities	 a	 misnomer	 for	 this	 market
sector.	 Brandt	 started	 his	 trading	 career	 in	 the	 commodity	 trading	 pits	 in	 the
quaint	old	days	when	futures	market	transactions	were	executed	in	the	bedlam	of
a	ring	of	screaming	brokers,	in	stark	contrast	to	the	quiet	efficiency	of	current-
day	electronic	trading.

Brandt’s	trading	career	encompasses	27	years—an	initial	14-year	span	and	the
current	ongoing	13-year	span—with	the	two	trading	segments	separated	by	an
11-year	hiatus.	The	reasons	for	this	lengthy	interruption	in	his	trading	career	are
discussed	in	the	interview.	Brandt	does	not	have	his	performance	records	prior	to
late	 1981.	 Over	 the	 entire	 27	 years	 he	 traded	 since	 then,	 Brandt	 achieved	 an
impressive	average	annual	compounded	return	of	58%.	Brandt,	though,	is	quick
to	 explain	 that	 this	 return	 is	 inflated	 because	 he	 traded	 his	 account	 very
aggressively—a	point	borne	out	by	his	very	high	average	annualized	volatility
(53%).

Brandt	provides	the	perfect	example	of	a	trader	for	whom	the	ubiquitous	Sharpe
ratio	greatly	understates	the	quality	of	the	performance.	One	major	flaw	inherent
in	the	Sharpe	ratio	is	that	the	risk	component	of	the	measure	(volatility)	does	not


distinguish	 between	 upside	 and	 downside	 volatility.	 In	 regards	 to	 the	 risk
measure,	large	gains	are	viewed	as	equally	bad	as	large	losses,	a	characteristic
that	completely	contradicts	most	people’s	intuitive	notion	of	risk.	A	trader	such
as	 Brandt,	 who	 experiences	 sporadic	 large	 gains,	 is	 penalized	 by	 the	 Sharpe
ratio,	even	though	his	losses	are	well	contained.

The	 _adjusted_ 	Sortino	ratio	is	an	alternative	return/risk	metric	that	utilizes	losses
instead	 of	 volatility	 as	 the	 risk	 measure,	 thereby	 eliminating	 penalization	 for
large	gains.	The	adjusted	Sortino	ratio	is	directly	comparable	to	the	Sharpe	ratio

(the	same	is	not	true	for	the	conventionally	calculated	Sortino	ratio).^1 	A	higher
adjusted	 Sortino	 ratio	 (as	 compared	 with	 the	 Sharpe	 ratio)	 implies	 that	 the
distribution	of	returns	is	 _positively	skewed	_ (a	greater	tendency	for	large	gains
than	large	losses).	And,	similarly,	a	lower	adjusted	Sortino	ratio	implies	returns
are	 _negatively	skewed	_ (a	greater	propensity	for	large	losses	than	large	gains).	For
most	traders,	the	Sharpe	ratio	and	the	adjusted	Sortino	ratio	will	be	roughly	in
the	same	general	vicinity.	In	Brandt’s	case,	however,	because	his	largest	gains
are	much	greater	than	his	largest	losses,	his	adjusted	Sortino	ratio	(3.00)	is	nearly
triple	his	Sharpe	ratio	(1.11)!	As	another	reflection	of	the	strength	of	Brandt’s

return/risk	performance,	his	monthly	Gain	to	Pain	ratio^2 	is	very	high	at	2.81—a
particularly	impressive	level	in	light	of	the	length	of	his	track	record.

Brandt	is	the	one	trader	in	this	book	for	whom	the	title	adjective	“unknown”	is
not	entirely	apropos.	Although	through	the	vast	majority	of	his	career	he	was
indeed	 unknown,	 and	 he	 is	 still	 not	 widely	 known	 in	 the	 broader	 financial
community,	 in	 recent	 years,	 through	 his	 _Factor_ market	 letter	 and	 a	 rapidly
growing	 Twitter	 following,	 he	 has	 gained	 recognition	 and	 respect	 from	 a
segment	of	the	trader	community.	Indeed,	several	of	the	traders	I	interviewed	for
this	book	cited	Brandt	as	an	important	influence.	But	I	had	strong	motivations
for	including	Brandt	in	this	book	that	overrode	my	preference	for	maintaining
the	purity	of	the	title.

In	 a	 way,	 Brandt	 was	 the	 catalyst	 for	 moving	 me	 from	 writing	 this	 book
“someday”	to	beginning	the	preliminary	steps	for	the	project.	I	knew	that	if	I
wrote	another	 _Market	Wizards_ 	book,	I	wanted	Brandt	to	be	in	it.	Brandt	and	I	are
friends.	I	was	familiar	with	his	views	about	trading,	which	I	thought	were	spot
on,	and	I	felt	I	would	always	regret	it	if	I	failed	to	capture	his	perspective	in	a
book.	At	the	time,	Brandt	lived	in	Colorado	Springs	and	mentioned	to	me	that	he
was	moving	to	Arizona	in	a	few	months.	Since	I	lived	only	about	100	miles
away	in	Boulder,	Colorado,	I	thought	it	would	be	more	efficient	to	interview	him


before	he	moved	and	that	doing	so	would	provide	the	ancillary	benefit	of	getting
the	book	started.	Ironically,	by	the	time	I	got	around	to	scheduling	the	interview,
Brandt	had	already	moved	to	Tucson.

When	I	arrived	at	the	airport,	Brandt	was	waiting	for	me	at	the	bottom	of	the	exit
escalator.	I	was	glad	to	see	him	again.	Although	it	had	only	been	a	little	over	a
year	since	we	last	met,	his	walking	posture	had	noticeably	changed,	with	his
back	bent	slightly	forward.	Thirty-five	years	earlier,	Brandt	suffered	a	terrible
accident.	He	had	gotten	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	to	go	to	the	bathroom.	He
recalls	wondering	in	annoyance,	“Who	left	this	chair	in	the	middle	of	the	hall?”
Brandt	was	sleepwalking.	The	“chair”	was	actually	the	railing	of	the	upper	deck.
He	clambered	past	the	obstacle,	and	the	next	thing	he	knew,	he	was	flat	on	his
back,	unable	to	move.	Brandt	had	fallen	nearly	twenty	feet.	He	suddenly	realized
what	had	happened.	So	did	his	wife,	Mona,	who,	upon	hearing	the	crash	of	the
fall,	immediately	dialed	911.

Brandt	spent	over	40	days	in	the	hospital,	wearing	a	body	cast	and	sandwiched
between	two	mattresses	that	could	be	rotated	regularly	to	change	his	position.
Since	the	accident,	Brandt	has	had	a	half-dozen	surgeries	on	his	back,	and	now
with	age,	his	back	is	visibly	bothering	him	more.	He	lives	with	constant	pain—
something	I	know	only	because	I	have	asked	him	about	it.	He	is	a	bit	of	a	stoic
and	 never	 complains	 about	 the	 pain,	 nor	 does	 he	 take	 any	 pain	 medication
because	he	doesn’t	like	how	it	makes	him	feel.

Brandt	drove	me	to	his	home,	which	is	situated	in	a	gated	community	on	the
outskirts	 of	 Tucson.	 We	 conducted	 the	 interview	 sitting	 in	 Brandt’s	 backyard
patio	overlooking	the	Sonora	desert,	which	is	surprisingly	verdant,	having	more
plant	species	than	any	other	desert	in	the	world,	some	of	which	grow	nowhere
else,	such	as	the	iconic	saguaro	cactus.	A	double-peaked	mountain	loomed	over
the	distant	horizon.	It	was	a	beautiful	spring	day.	The	steady	breeze	generated	a
constant	clattering	of	wind	chimes.	“Are	those	going	to	be	a	problem	for	your
recorder?”	Brandt	asked.	“No,	it	will	be	fine,”	I	assured	him.	Little	did	I	think
about	the	many	hours	I	would	spend	playing	and	replaying	the	recordings	having
to	listen	to	those	damn	wind	chimes.

**When	you	were	young,	did	you	have	any	idea	what	you	wanted	to	do	with
your	life?**


I	grew	up	dirt	poor,	raised	by	a	single	mom.	It	was	really	up	to	me	to	make	my
own	money.	Even	back	then,	I	was	extremely	entrepreneurial.	I	had	two	large
paper	routes.	I’d	wake	up	5	a.m.	on	Sunday	to	deliver	150	newspapers	on	my
wagon	or	my	sled	if	there	was	snow.	I	collected	bottles.	I’d	hand	out	shopper
bills	for	the	local	grocery	store.

**How	old	were	you	then?**

Oh,	I	started	working	when	I	was	about	10.

**What	was	your	major	in	college?**

I	majored	in	advertising,	and	I	really	loved	it.

**How	did	you	go	from	advertising	to	trading?**

Two	things	introduced	me	to	the	idea	of	trading.	I	had	a	brother	who	was	buying
bags	of	silver	coins.	Back	then,	in	the	late	1960s	and	early	1970s,	US	citizens
were	not	allowed	to	own	gold,	but	you	could	own	silver	coins.	At	that	time,	my
brother	was	buying	these	bags	of	silver	coins	at	a	premium	of	20%	over	face
value.	It	was	a	perfect	example	of	an	asymmetric	risk	trade:	you	could	lose	a
maximum	of	20%,	but	if	metal	prices	went	higher,	the	upside	was	unlimited.

**Did	you	buy	silver	coins	yourself	as	well?**

No,	I	couldn’t.	I	had	no	money.	But	I	was	intrigued.	I	bought	 _The Wall	Street
Journal_ 	to	follow	the	price	of	silver.	My	brother	had	started	buying	silver	coins
when	the	price	of	silver	was	$1.50	per	ounce.	By	1974,	the	price	of	silver	had
more	 than	 tripled,	 soaring	 above	 $4.50.	 My	 brother	 was	 driving	 around	 in	 a
Mercedes-Benz.

**You	said	two	things	influenced	you	to	get	into	trading.	What	was	the	second
one?**

At	 the	 time,	 I	 was	 living	 in	 Chicago,	 and	 I	 met	 a	 fellow	 who	 traded	 in	 the
soybean	pits.	Both	of	our	sons	played	hockey,	and	I	got	to	know	him	pretty	well.
He	said,	“Peter,	come	on	down	and	see	what	I	do.	I’ll	buy	you	lunch.”	So	I	met
my	 friend	 for	 lunch	 at	 the	 Board	 of	 Trade.	 The	 restaurant	 had	 these	 huge
windows	overlooking	the	pits.	As	I	watched	the	traders	below,	my	reaction	was,
“Whoa!”	I	was	fascinated.	It	sparked	something	inside	of	me	that	said,	“I	want	to
do	this.”	I	peppered	my	friend	with	questions	about	being	a	trader.	I	picked	up
all	the	brochures	at	the	Board	of	Trade.

**Were	you	working	in	advertising	at	the	time?**

I	was.

**Were	you	satisfied	with	your	job?**


I	was	on	a	fast	track	with	the	fifth	largest	advertising	agency	in	the	world.	I	had
lots	of	responsibility,	and	my	accounts	included	Campbell	and	McDonald’s.

**Were	you	involved	in	any	of	the	commercials?**

Yes,	the	McDonald’s	grab-a-bucket-and-mop	commercial.	You	can	check	it	out
on	YouTube.	I	also	was	there	when	they	created	Ronald	McDonald.

**So	you	liked	what	you	were	doing?**

I	liked	what	I	was	doing.	The	only	thing	I	didn’t	like	was	the	politics	in	the
corporate	world.	Also,	there	was	something	about	what	the	guys	on	the	floor
were	doing	that	captivated	me.	I	liked	the	idea	that	they	knew	how	they	did	at
the	end	of	each	day.	And	they	only	worked	from	9:30	to	1:15!	Also,	part	of	the
attraction	was	that	I	found	out	what	these	guys	were	making.

**That’s	because	you	didn’t	know	about	the	95%	plus	of	people	who	try	to
become	traders	and	go	broke.	You	had	what	the	statisticians	call	a	biased
sample.**

Oh,	I	found	that	out	later.	But,	at	the	time,	what	I	noticed	was	that	the	parking	lot
next	to	the	Board	of	Trade	was	filled	with	Mercedes	and	Porsches.

**Having	 grown	 up	 poor,	 was	 the	 wealth	 angle	 a	 significant	 part	 of	 your
attraction	to	trading?**

Yes,	that	was	a	big	thing.

**How	did	you	go	from	that	desire	to	actually	getting	involved	in	trading?**

I	came	to	the	decision	that	I	wanted	to	be	in	this	business.	Even	then,	the	price	of
floor	membership	was	very	high.	There	was	no	way	I	could	afford	it.	Around
this	time,	my	brother	introduced	me	to	the	broker	he	was	using	to	buy	silver
coins.	His	broker	was	in	Minneapolis	and	worked	for	Continental	Grain,	which
at	the	time	was	the	second	most	prominent	name	on	the	Chicago	Board	of	Trade,
next	 to	 Cargill.	 My	 brother’s	 broker	 told	 me	 Continental	 Grain	 was	 hiring
people.

Before	1972,	there	was	very	little	public	speculation	in	the	grain	markets,	but
that	changed	with	the	big	bull	market	in	commodities	during	the	early	1970s.
Continental	was	the	first	mainline	Board	of	Trade	firm	to	put	a	major	effort	into
bringing	in	hedging	and	speculative	clients.	They	set	up	Conti	Commodities	as	a
subsidiary	to	do	brokerage	business.

**Didn’t	you	have	any	apprehension	about	taking	a	job	as	a	broker,	which	is
essentially	a	sales	job?**

No,	 because	 it	 was	 a	 way	 into	 the	 business.	 I	 was	 in	 Conti’s	 first	 training


program	for	commodity	brokers.	They	accepted	eight	people	into	the	program,
which	lasted	three	months.

**Did	you	get	any	salary,	or	were	you	totally	dependent	on	commissions?**

They	gave	you	a	draw	for	six	months.	I	don’t	remember	the	exact	amount,	but	it
was	approximately	$1,300	a	month,	give	or	take.	I	do	remember	that	my	salary
at	the	advertising	firm	was	$28,000	per	year	when	I	left.	So	I	was	definitely
taking	a	pay	cut.

**Once	you	finished	the	training	program	and	started	your	job	as	a	broker,
how	did	you	get	clients?**

The	first	thing	I	did	was	to	head	back	to	New	Jersey	to	visit	Campbell	and	then
out	to	Oak	Brook	to	visit	McDonald’s.

**Oh,	because	you	had	the	connections	through	your	advertising	job.**

Yes,	I	had	the	connections,	and	they	were	high-level	connections.	They	knew	me
well,	and	it	so	happened	that	all	these	major	food	processors	had	not	hedged
during	the	big	bull	market	in	commodities	we	had	just	seen.

They	 got	 caught	 with	 their	 pants	 down.	 They	 were	 hurt	 real	 bad	 as	 all	 their
ingredients—meats,	 soybean	 oil,	 sugar,	 cocoa,	 etc.—shot	 up,	 and	 they	 were
unhedged.	Back	then,	the	IRS	didn’t	even	know	how	to	handle	hedging	profits
and	losses.

This	 is	 late	 1974,	 right	 after	 the	 bull	 markets	 in	 1973	 and	 1974.	 I’m	 in	 the
business	one	to	two	years	after	the	start	of	the	modern	futures	industry,	as	we
know	it	today.	The	deal	I	offered	Campbell	was	that	if	they	sent	out	one	of	their
purchasing	agents	to	Chicago	for	two	months,	I	would	make	sure	he	got	trained
in	futures.	The	person	they	sent	out	ended	up	becoming	the	senior	purchasing
agent	for	Campbell,	and	I	had	that	account.	I	also	got	the	McDonald’s	account
and	some	other	hedgers.	So	I	was	doing	pretty	well	for	a	young	broker.

**Were	you	allowed	to	trade	your	own	speculative	account?**

Oh,	totally.

**So	when	did	you	start	trading?**

I	started	trading	around	1976,	by	which	time	I	had	saved	a	little	money.	I	knew
that	what	I	really	wanted	to	do	was	trade.

**Do	you	remember	your	first	trade?**

[He	thinks	 a	while	 and	 then	remembers.]	 It	was	 actually	 a	little	 bit	 earlier—
around	late	1975.	I	was	doing	enough	brokerage	business	so	that	Conti	assigned
me	a	badge	so	I	could	go	down	on	the	trading	floor.	My	friend,	John,	who	had


gotten	me	interested	in	trading,	was	a	soybean	trader.	One	day	I	see	him,	and	he
tells	me,	“Peter,	I’m	really	bullish	the	soybean	market.”	So	I	bought	a	contract.	I
had	no	idea	what	I	was	doing.	The	market	went	up	five	or	six	cents	and	then
came	right	down.	I	ended	up	getting	out	with	about	a	12-cent	loss	[a	$600	loss
for	a	one-contract	position].	I	remember	seeing	John	shortly	afterward,	and	he
greets	me	by	saying,	“Wasn’t	that	a	fabulous	price	move!”	What	I	subsequently
found	out	was	that	for	John,	who	traded	against	order	flow	in	the	pit,	a	1-	to	2-
cent	gain	was	a	really	good	trade,	and	a	six-cent	gain	was	a	“fabulous”	trade.
The	 big	 lesson	 for	 me	 was	 that	 the	 terms	 “bullish”	 or	 “bearish”	 don’t	 mean
anything.	 What	 is	 the	 person’s	 time	 horizon?	 What	 kind	 of	 move	 are	 they
looking	for?	What	price	or	events	would	tell	them	that	they	were	wrong?

**Where	did	your	trading	career	go	from	there?**

I	blew	out	three	or	four	accounts	over	the	next	three	years.	The	old	joke	was	that
you	 knew	 your	 account	 was	 in	 trouble	 when	 you	 are	 trading	 oats.	 [Oats	 are
typically	a	low	volatility	market,	and	the	contract	size	is	small	(in	dollar	value
terms),	so	the	margins	are	lower	than	they	are	for	other	grain	markets.]

**How	did	you	make	your	trading	decisions?**

At	first,	I	would	listen	to	the	Conti	fundamental	guys	who’d	come	on	the	firm’s
speaker	system	every	morning	before	the	markets	would	open	and	talk	about
what	 they	 were	 seeing.	 They	 would	 talk	 about	 stuff	 like	 grain	 shipments,
planting	 progress,	 and	 so	 on.	 They	 would	 also	 give	 their	 trading
recommendations.	 The	 first	 account	 I	 blew	 out	 was	 following	 their
recommendations.	 There	 was	 also	 a	 technical	 analyst	 in	 the	 Conti	 Memphis
office	 that	 would	 come	 on	 the	 broadcast	 every	 morning.	 He	 used	 point-and-
figure	charting	[a	style	of	price	charting	where	intervals	depend	on	price	moves
rather	 than	 time].	 He	 made	 a	 great	 call	 in	 the	 soybean	 market	 in	 1976.	 So	 I
bought	a	book	on	point-and-figure	charting	and	started	playing	around	with	that
approach.	There	went	the	second	account.	Then	I	took	a	fling	using	seasonal
patterns.	After	that,	I	tried	spread	trading	[trading	the	price	difference	between
two	futures	contracts	in	the	same	market	by	buying	a	contract	expiring	in	one
month	and	selling	a	contract	expiring	in	another	month].

**You	were	trying	to	find	a	methodology	that	worked	for	you.**

I	was	trying	to	find	something,	and	I	was	getting	frustrated.	But,	at	the	same
time,	I	consider	myself	lucky.	I	look	at	guys	today	who	start	trading	something
like	crypto,	max	out	their	student	loan	money,	and	end	up	living	in	their	mom’s
basement.	I	had	an	income	source	to	fall	back	on.	It	wasn’t	killing	me	that	I	was


losing.	I	wanted	to	learn	how	to	trade	and	become	a	profitable	trader.

**What	finally	broke	the	cycle	of	opening	an	account,	trying	some	different
methodology,	 losing	 your	 money	 over	 time,	 stopping	 trading,	 and	 then
repeating	the	process	all	over	again?**

There	were	probably	two	things	that	turned	the	process	around.	First,	I	learned
that	you	have	to	use	stops	because	you	can’t	afford	to	take	significant	losses.
Second,	one	day,	a	colleague	who	was	a	chartist	came	over	to	my	desk	and	said,
“Come	 with	 me.”	 We	 went	 downstairs,	 walked	 across	 the	 street	 and	 into	 the
bookstore.	He	bought	me	the	Edwards	and	Magee	book	[ _Technical	Analysis	of
Stock	 Trends_ ].	 I	 just	 gobbled	 this	 book	 up.	 Now,	 someone	 else	 might	 read
Edwards	and	Magee	and	not	get	anything	out	of	it.	But	for	me,	it	put	a	lot	of
square	 pegs	 in	 square	 holes	 and	 round	 pegs	 in	 round	 holes.	 It	 gave	 me	 a
framework	for	understanding	price.	It	gave	me	an	idea	of	where	to	get	into	a
market.	 Before	 I	 read	 Edwards	 and	 Magee,	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 I	 was	 doing.
Where	do	you	get	into	a	trade?	I	didn’t	have	a	clue.	It	also	gave	me	a	way	to
establish	where	to	protect	myself	on	a	trade	and	an	idea	of	where	the	market
might	go.	That	book	is	what	brought	me	into	charting.	I	saw	the	light	at	the	end
of	the	tunnel.	I	saw	there	was	a	chance	that	I	could	develop	myself	as	a	trader,
and	the	account	I	opened	to	trade	charts	did	well.

**So	was	that	the	point	of	demarcation	between	trading	failure	and	trading
success?**

Yes.	In	1979	I	had	an	account	that	was	gaining	traction.	When	I	look	back	now,
the	account	had	a	lot	more	volatility	than	it	should	have.	I	still	hadn’t	worked	out
proper	position	sizing,	but	for	the	first	time	since	I	started	trading,	my	account
was	moving	steadily	north.

**Was	the	broker	who	bought	you	the	book	a	successful	trader?**

He	never	gained	success.	He	is	a	dear	friend,	but	he	never	made	it	as	a	trader.

**It’s	ironic	that	he	was	instrumental	in	your	trading	success,	but	was	never
successful	himself.	I	guess	that	the	book	he	bought	you	was	the	best	present
you	ever	got.**

Oh	yes!	Let	me	show	you	something.	[He	leaves	and	comes	back	a	minute	later
with	a	book.]	I	was	looking	for	a	first	edition	of	Edwards	and	Magee	for	years
and	 had	 queries	 out	 to	 several	 rare	 book	 dealers.	 I	 finally	 found	 a	 copy	 that
Magee	himself	had	inscribed	and	given	to	a	friend	in	Boston.

**I	assume	you	were	still	managing	your	commercial	hedging	accounts	at	the
time.	When	did	you	make	the	transition	from	broker	to	full-time	trader?**


About	a	year	later.

**Couldn’t	you	continue	to	broker	those	accounts	and	still	trade	your	own
account?**

I	could	have,	but	I	didn’t	want	to.

**Why	not?**

I	just	wanted	to	trade.

**But	weren’t	you	walking	away	from	a	large	amount	of	brokerage	income	by
giving	up	those	accounts?**

I	would	have,	but	I	sold	the	accounts.

**I	didn’t	know	you	could	do	that.**

You	could;	I	received	a	trail	of	the	commissions	on	the	accounts	I	turned	over.

**Since	these	were	prize	commercial	accounts,	how	did	you	pick	the	broker
you	could	entrust	the	accounts	to?**

I	gave	it	to	a	guy	who	was	my	biggest	mentor.	His	name	was	Dan	Markey,	and
he	was	probably	one	of	the	best	traders	I	ever	met.

**How	did	he	trade?**

He	 used	 to	 say,	 “I	 look	 at	 the	 markets	 through	 the	 lens	 of	 History	 101,
Economics	101,	and	Psychology	101.”	He	was	a	boy	wonder	at	Conti.	He	was	a
real	position	trader	who	would	hold	big	grain	positions	for	months	at	a	time.	He
had	a	great	sense	of	when	markets	were	at	a	major	turning	point.	He	would	say,
“Corn	is	bottoming	right	now.	This	is	the	season	low.”	And	he	would	be	right.

**Was	that	just	intuitive?**

Yes,	intuitive.	He	couldn’t	tell	you	why.

**So	he	was	actually	going	short	into	strength	and	long	into	weakness.**

He	was.

**So,	ironically,	he	was	doing	exactly	the	opposite	of	what	you	were	doing.**

Yes,	the	total	opposite.

**But	you	said	he	was	a	mentor.	So	what	did	you	learn	from	him?**

Risk	management.	While	he	was	buying	into	weakness,	he	wouldn’t	just	put	on	a
full	position	and	hold	it.	He	would	probe	the	market	for	a	low.	He	would	get	out
of	any	trade	that	had	a	loss	at	the	end	of	the	week	and	then	try	again	the	next
time	he	thought	the	timing	was	right.	He	kept	probing,	probing,	probing.

**That’s	 interesting	 because	 one	 of	 the	 things	 I’ve	 heard	 you	 say	 is	 that**


**anytime	you	have	a	loss	in	a	trade	at	the	end	of	the	week,	you	get	out.	I	take
it	that	watching	Dan	trade	40	years	ago	is	where	this	idea	comes	from.	So
you’ve	used	this	idea	for	virtually	all	of	your	trading	life.**

Oh,	 I	 have.	 Dan	 used	 to	 say,	 “There	 are	 two	 parts	 to	 a	 trade:	 direction	 and
timing.	And,	if	you’re	wrong	about	either	one,	you’re	wrong	on	the	trade.”

**Anything	else	that	you	learned	from	Dan?**

Yes,	 I	 saw	 that	 he	 took	 much	 smaller	 positions	 than	 he	 could.	 The	 lesson	 I
learned	from	Dan	was	that	if	you	could	protect	your	capital,	you	would	always
have	another	shot.	But	you	had	to	protect	your	pile	of	chips.

**And	you	had	lost	your	pile	of	chips	several	times.**

I	had.	I	had.

**It’s	interesting	that	all	of	Dan’s	advice	deals	with	risk	management,	and
none	of	it	has	anything	to	do	with	trade	entry,	which	is	what	most	people
want	to	focus	on.	Were	there	any	other	significant	mentors?**

Dan	was	by	far	the	most	significant.	The	most	crucial	other	advice	I	had	was
from	a	trader	who	was	a	chartist.	He	said,	“Peter,	you	have	to	have	an	edge	to
make	 money,	 and	 a	 chart	 pattern	 does	 not	 give	 you	 an	 edge.”	 That	 was	 a
sobering	comment	at	the	time,	and	it	didn’t	make	complete	sense	to	me	then,	but
it	did	about	five	years	later.

**I	 guess	 what	 he	 was	 saying	 is	 that	 anyone	 else	 can	 see	 the	 same	 chart
patterns.**

Yes,	and	also	chart	patterns	are	subject	to	failure.	I	know	that	one	thing	both	you
and	I	agree	on	is	that	when	a	chart	pattern	fails,	that	is	a	more	reliable	signal	than
the	chart	pattern	itself.	[I	not	only	agree,	but	I	titled	the	chapter	in	my	book	on
futures	market	analysis	discussing	this	exact	concept,	“The	Most	Important	Rule

in	Chart	Analysis.”^3 ]	Also,	chart	patterns	morph.	You	think	you	have	a	handle	on
the	chart	pattern,	and	then	it	changes	into	another	pattern.	A	morphing	chart	is
nothing	 more	 than	 a	 bunch	 of	 patterns	 that	 fail	 and	 don’t	 do	 what	 they’re
supposed	to	do.

**So	what	happened	after	you	turned	over	your	accounts	to	Dan	to	focus
solely	on	trading?**

In	1980,	I	incorporated	Factor	Research	and	Trading	and	rented	an	office.

**Why	did	you	pick	the	name	** **_Factor_****?**

That	was	my	own	inside	joke.	From	1975	through	1978,	I	did	a	really	good	job
providing	Campbell	with	fundamental	information	and	helping	them	with	their


hedging	decisions.	By	1979,	I	had	gotten	the	hang	of	chart	analysis,	and	I	started
seeing	 some	 significant	 potential	 price	 movements	 in	 the	 grain	 markets.	 I
couldn’t	 exactly	 go	 to	 Campbell	 and	 tell	 them	 that	 I	 thought	 they	 should	 be
hedging	because	I	saw	a	 _head-and-shoulders_ 	bottom	forming	in	the	market.	So,	I
would	go	to	Dan	Markey	or	some	of	the	other	fundamental	guys	when	soybeans
were	at	$6,	and	say,	“I	think	soybeans	are	going	to	$9.	What	do	you	see	in	the
markets?”	And	they	would	give	me	some	sort	of	fundamental	narrative	of	how
such	a	move	could	happen.

The	guys	at	the	CBOT	would	hear	me	talking	to	Campbell	and	saying	stuff	like,
“We	could	be	seeing	some	anchovy	problems	off	the	coast.”	[Anchovies	are	used
to	 produce	 fishmeal,	 which	 is	 a	 substitute	 for	 soybean	 meal.]	 I	 was	 really
speaking	my	charts,	but	I	was	giving	them	my	opinion	in	terms	of	fundamentals.
So	they	started	calling	it	the	“Brandt	bullshit	factor.”

**What	were	you	planning	to	do	with	the	company?	Were	you	planning	to
manage	money?**

No,	just	trade	my	own	account.

**But	you	didn’t	need	to	have	a	company	to	trade	your	account.**

I	know,	but	I	just	liked	the	feel	of	having	my	own	trading	company.

**Has	your	methodology	changed	from	what	you	were	doing	when	you	started
as	a	full-time	trader?**

There	are	some	substantial	differences.

**What	are	they?**

Back	then,	I	would	have	popcorn	trades.

**Popcorn	trades?**

You	know	how	a	kernel	of	corn	pops,	goes	up	to	the	top	of	the	canister,	and	then
falls	all	way	back	down	to	the	bottom?	A	popcorn	trade	is	what	I	call	a	trade	that
you	have	a	profit	on	and	then	ride	it	all	way	back	down	to	where	you	got	in.	I	try
to	avoid	popcorn	trades	now.

**What	else	has	changed?**

The	charts	have	become	much	less	reliable.	It	was	much	easier	to	trade	on	charts
in	 the	 1970s	 and	 1980s.	 The	 patterns	 were	 nice	 and	 neat.	 There	 were	 fewer
_whipsaw_ 	markets.	[A	 _whipsaw_ 	market	is	a	market	in	which	prices	swing	widely
back	 and	 forth,	 causing	 trend-following	 traders	 to	 be	 positioned	 wrong	 right
before	 the	 market	 abruptly	 reverses	 direction.]	 Back	 then,	 if	 you	 saw	 a	 chart
pattern,	you	could	take	the	money	to	the	bank.	The	patterns	were	so	dependable.


**I	have	my	own	theory	why	that	may	be	the	case.	How	do	you	explain	it?**

I	 think	 high-frequency	 trading	 operations	 have	 created	 volatility	 around	 chart
_breakout_ 	points.	[A	 _breakout	_ is	a	price	movement	above	or	below	a	prior	 _trading
range	_ (sideways	 movement	 in	 prices)	 or	 consolidation	 pattern	 (e.g.,	 triangle,
flag,	etc.).	The	underlying	concept	is	that	the	ability	of	prices	to	move	beyond	a
prior	 trading	 range	 or	 consolidation	 pattern	 indicates	 a	 potential	 trend	 in	 the
direction	of	the	breakout.]

**But	they	trade	so	short	term.	Why	would	they	impact	volatility?**

Because	 they	 create	 volatility	 _at_ the	 breakout	 points.	 It	 is	 very	 short-term
volatility,	but	it	can	knock	a	trader	like	me	out	of	a	position.	I	also	think	that	the
markets	are	more	mature	now	with	bigger	players.	What’s	your	view	about	why
the	markets	have	changed?

**My	perception	is	that	once	too	many	people	are	doing	the	same	thing,	by
definition,	it	becomes	impossible	for	that	technique	to	continue	working	as
before.**

I	think	that’s	true.	Back	then,	there	weren’t	a	lot	of	people	looking	at	charts.

**What	else	has	changed	in	your	approach	from	the	early	days?**

I	used	to	trade	one-	to	four-week	patterns,	now	I	trade	8-	to	26-week	patterns.

**Because	they	are	more	reliable?**

Yes.

**Any	other	changes	in	the	types	of	signals	you	take?**

I	used	to	trade	any	pattern	I	could	see.	I	would	trade	30	to	35	patterns	a	month.
Now,	 I	 am	 much	 more	 selective.	 I	 used	 to	 trade	 patterns	 like	 symmetrical
triangles	and	trendlines,	which	I	no	longer	do.	I	only	trade	patterns	where	the
breakout	is	through	a	horizontal	boundary.

**Why	is	that?**

With	horizontal	boundaries,	you	can	find	out	much	more	quickly	whether	you
are	right	or	wrong.

**Was	there	a	catalyst	for	that	change?**

No,	it	was	just	a	gradual	process	of	realizing	that	I	was	getting	my	best	results
trading	rectangles,	ascending	triangles,	and	descending	triangles.	Give	me	a	10-
week	rectangle	with	a	well-defined	boundary	that	ends	with	a	wide	daily	bar
breakout	out	of	that	pattern,	and	now	we’re	cooking.

**But	you	still	have	to	deal	with	the	issue	of	the	market	dipping	back	even	on**


**valid	 breakouts.	 What	 happens	 if	 you	 buy	 a	 breakout,	 and	 the	 market
reacts	 enough	 to	 trigger	 your	 stop	 but	 then	 holds,	 and	 the	 longer-term
pattern	still	looks	good?**

I	will	take	a	second	chance	but	never	more	than	a	second	chance.	And	I	won’t
take	the	second	chance	on	the	same	day.	I	remember	guys	on	the	Board	of	Trade
complaining,	“I’ve	lost	30	cents	in	a	10-cent	range.”	I	don’t	want	to	lose	30	cents
in	a	ten-cent	range,	and	I	know	it’s	possible	to	do.

**If	you	get	stopped	out	a	second	time,	and	that	pattern	ends	up	being	a
major	price	base	before	a	long-term	trend,	does	that	mean	you	miss	the
entire	move?**

Not	 necessarily.	 I	 might	 still	 get	 back	 in	 if	 the	 market	 forms	 a	 continuation
pattern	[a	consolidation	within	the	trend].	But	I	would	look	at	it	as	an	entirely
new	trade.

**So	it	wouldn’t	bother	you	going	long	at	$1.50	after	getting	stopped	out	twice
at	$1.20?**

No,	that	has	never	bothered	me.	I	think	that	type	of	thinking	is	a	trap	that	people
fall	into.	I	trade	price	change;	I	don’t	trade	price	level.

**Is	there	anything	else	that	you	have	changed	over	the	years?**

Yes,	the	risk	I	take	on	a	trade	is	much	lower	now.	Whenever	I	take	a	trade,	I	limit
my	risk	to	about	1/2%	of	my	equity	from	the	point	of	entry.	I	want	to	have	my
stops	at	breakeven	or	better	within	two	or	three	days	of	entry.	My	average	loss
last	year	was	23	basis	points.

**Protective	stops	are	integral	to	your	trading	methodology.	I’m	curious,	do
you	leave	stops	in	place	during	the	overnight	session?	[With	the	advent	of
electronic	trading,	futures	markets	trade	through	the	night.	The	inherent
dilemma	is	that	if	a	protective	stop	order	is	not	left	in	place	for	the	night
session,	 a	 large	 overnight	 price	 move	 could	 result	 in	 a	 trade	 losing
significantly	more	than	intended	by	the	stop-risk	point.	On	the	other	hand,
leaving	a	stop	in	place	for	the	night	session	runs	the	risk	of	the	stop	being
activated	by	a	meaningless	price	move	on	thin	volume.]**

It	depends	on	the	market.	I	wouldn’t	use	an	overnight	stop	for	the	Mexican	peso,
but	I	would	use	one	for	the	euro	because	it	is	so	liquid.	Similarly,	I	wouldn’t	use
an	overnight	stop	in	copper,	but	I	would	in	gold.

**What	was	the	first	bad	year	you	had	as	a	full-time	trader?**

1988.


**So	you	had	nine	good	years	before	that	losing	year.	What	went	wrong	in
1988?**

I	got	sloppy.	I	would	enter	chart	patterns	too	early.	I	would	chase	markets.	I
didn’t	have	orders	in	when	I	should	have.

**Why,	to	use	your	own	term,	did	your	trading	get	“sloppy”	in	1988?**

I	think	because	1987	was	such	a	good	year.	I	was	up	600%	in	1987.	It	was	my
best	year	ever.	I’ll	never	be	there	again.	I	think	I	came	out	of	that	year	a	bit
complacent.

**How	much	did	you	lose	in	1988?**

Oh,	about	5%.

**When	did	you	get	back	on	track?**

1989.	Having	a	losing	year	made	me	realize	that	I	had	to	get	back	to	the	basics.

**What	do	you	know	now	that	you	wish	you	knew	when	you	started	out	as	a
trader?**

I	think	the	big	one	is	to	forgive	myself.	I	am	going	to	make	mistakes.

**What	else?**

I	have	learned	that	you	can	believe	you	know	where	the	market	is	going,	but	you
really	don’t	have	a	clue.	I	now	know	that	I	am	my	own	worst	enemy	and	that	my
natural	instincts	will	often	lead	me	astray.	I	am	an	impulsive	person.	If	I	didn’t
have	a	process	and	instead	just	looked	at	my	screen	for	where	to	enter	orders,	I
would	self-destruct.	It’s	only	when	I	override	my	instincts	through	the	process	of
disciplined	order	entry	that	I	put	myself	in	the	position	where	what	I	do	with
charts	can	work	for	me.	I	have	to	be	so	intentional	in	the	way	I	trade.	My	edge
comes	from	the	process.	I	am	a	glorified	order	enterer;	I	am	not	a	trader.	Some	of
the	orders	I	place	go	against	my	natural	inclination	in	a	market.	They	are	hard
orders	to	enter.

**Why?**

Copper	has	been	in	a	40-cent	trading	range	for	nearly	a	year,	and	just	today,	I
bought	 copper	 near	 a	 new	 recent	 high.	 That’s	 hard	 to	 do.	 [As	 it	 turned	 out,
Brandt	had	bought	copper	on	the	high	day	of	the	upmove	and	was	stopped	out
the	next	day.	This	trade	was	actually	quite	typical	for	Brandt.	The	majority	of	his
trades	will	result	in	a	quick	loss.	He	succeeds,	nonetheless,	because	his	average
gain	is	much	larger	than	his	average	loss.]

I	 think	 that	 most	 of	 my	 big	 profits	 have	 come	 from	 trades	 that	 were
counterintuitive.	How	I	feel	about	a	trade	is	not	a	good	indicator	of	how	the	trade


will	end	up.	I	think	that	if	I	made	my	biggest	bets	on	those	trades	I	felt	best
about,	it	would	substantially	degrade	my	performance.	A	current	example	is	that
I’ve	wanted	to	be	a	bull	on	grains	for	a	year	now.

**Why?**

Because	grains	are	at	very	low	price	levels.	They	are	scraping	at	the	bottom.	I
think	my	first	trade	in	corn,	which	was	over	40	years	ago,	was	at	a	higher	price
than	we	are	at	right	now.

**So	given	the	inflation	we	have	had	since	then,	prices	are	extraordinarily	low.**

Yes,	and	I	have	tried	buying	grains	multiple	times	this	year	with	these	trades
resulting	in	a	net	loss.	My	best	trade	in	grains	this	year	was	actually	on	the	short
side	of	Kansas	City	wheat.	In	fact,	it	was	my	third	best	trade	of	the	year.	And	I
made	that	trade	only	because	I	couldn’t	deny	the	chart.	I	felt	that	if	I	was	not
going	to	short	Kansas	City	wheat	on	 _that_ 	chart	pattern,	why	was	I	even	bothering
to	look	at	the	chart?	I	had	to	go	against	my	instincts	that	grains	were	forming	a
major	bottom.

**So,	ironically,	your	best	trade	in	that	sector	during	the	year	was	precisely
opposite	to	what	you	were	expecting.	It’s	like	you	have	to	bring	yourself	to
bet	against	the	team	you’re	rooting	for.**

You	do.

**Has	that	been	true	over	the	years—that	is,	have	your	best	trades	tended	to
be	the	ones	you	least	expected	to	work?**

I	 think	 that’s	 true.	 If	 anything,	 I	 think	 there	 may	 be	 an	 inverse	 correlation
between	how	I	feel	about	a	trade	and	how	it	turns	out.

**Why	do	you	think	that	is?**

Because	it	is	easy	to	believe	in	a	trade	that	conforms	to	conventional	wisdom.	It
used	to	bother	me	to	be	wrong	on	a	trade.	I	would	take	it	personally.	Whereas
now,	I	take	pride	in	the	fact	that	I	can	be	wrong	10	times	in	a	row.	I	understand
that	my	edge	comes	from	the	fact	that	I	have	become	so	good	at	taking	losses.

**So	instead	of	being	bothered	by	losing	on	a	trade,	you’re	proud	that	you	can
take	these	small	losses	that	prevent	a	large	loss	from	accumulating.	In	that
light,	taking	a	loss	on	a	trade	is	not	a	sign	of	a	defect	but	rather	a	reflection
of	a	personal	strength	that	explains	why	you	have	been	successful	in	the
long	run.**

A	trader’s	job	is	to	take	losses.	A	losing	trade	doesn’t	imply	you	did	anything
wrong.	The	hard	part	about	trading	is	that	you	can	do	the	right	thing	and	still


lose	money.	There	is	not	a	direct	feedback	loop	that	tells	you,	“good	job.”	I	only
have	control	over	the	orders	I	place.	I	don’t	have	control	over	the	outcome	of
trades.	Whenever	I	place	a	trade,	I	think,	“A	year	from	now	when	I	look	back	at
the	chart,	will	I	be	able	to	see	in	the	chart	the	day	and	the	price	at	which	I	took	a
position?”	If	the	answer	is	yes,	then	it	is	a	good	trade,	regardless	of	whether	it
wins	or	loses.

**What	 else	 would	 have	 been	 helpful	 to	 know	 when	 you	 started	 out	 as	 a
trader?**

Actually,	if	I	had	been	as	risk-averse	in	my	early	years	as	I	am	now,	I	would
never	have	had	that	string	of	giant	winning	years	in	the	1980s.

**What	level	of	risk	were	you	taking?**

Oh,	I	could	take	as	much	as	a	10%	risk	on	a	single	trade.	Not	every	trade,	of
course,	but	it	would	sometimes	be	that	high.

**So	as	much	as	twentyfold	the	risk	you	take	per	trade	now!**

Yes.

**Ironically,	 it	 sounds	 like	 the	 fact	 that	 you	 were	 operating	 under
misconceptions	of	appropriate	risk	in	those	earlier	years	was	beneficial	to
you.	I	have	always	believed	that	successful	people	may	be	successful	because
of	some	innate	skill,	talent	or	drive,	but	that	there	is	also	usually	some
significant	luck	involved.	You	can	have	people	with	all	the	potential	in	the
world,	and	nothing	ever	happens.	Your	story	is	an	illustration	of	that.	You
did	the	wrong	thing	in	the	beginning	by	trading	much	too	large,	but	it	all
worked	out	exceptionally	well.	You	could	just	as	easily	have	blown	out	your
account	again.**

Oh,	Jack,	totally.	It’s	only	been	in	the	last	10	years	that	I	have	reflected	on	the
fact	that	my	success	as	a	trader	is	mainly	due	to	what	I	am	going	to	call	“cosmic
sovereignty.”	 I	 started	 in	 the	 business	 when	 I	 did.	 I	 had	 certain	 people	 that
mentored	me	when	they	did.	I	was	with	the	right	firm	when	I	started	out.	I	had
the	right	accounts	because	of	my	previous	job	in	advertising.	I	started	trading	at
a	time	when	the	markets	were	perfectly	attuned	to	my	style	of	chart	trading.	I	bet
10%–15%	of	my	account	on	long	Swiss	franc	and	Deutsche	mark	positions,	and
it	turned	into	a	giant	profit	instead	of	killing	me.	I	can’t	take	credit	for	any	of
that.	None	of	that	is	due	to	my	own	intelligence	or	abilities.	None	of	that	is	due
to	who	I	am.	That’s	cosmic	sovereignty.

**How	 did	 you	 get	 to	 manage	 money	 for	 Commodities	 Corporation?
[Commodities	 Corporation	 was	 a	 proprietary	 trading	 firm	 in	 Princeton,**


**New	Jersey.	The	firm	gained	legendary	status	because	some	of	the	traders	it
seeded	would	go	on	to	become	among	the	world’s	best	traders,	probably
first	 and	 foremost	 being	 Michael	 Marcus	 and	 Bruce	 Kovner	 who	 were**

**featured	in	the	original	** **_Market	Wizards_** **	book.**^4 **]**

I	don’t	recall	how	it	started,	but	they	reached	out	to	me.	I	think	somebody	at	the
Board	 of	 Trade	 may	 have	 recommended	 me.	 I	 flew	 down	 to	 Newark	 for	 the
interview	 and	 was	 picked	 up	 by	 a	 limousine	 that	 drove	 me	 to	 the	 _castle_.
[Commodities	Corporation	was	not	literally	in	a	castle,	but	Brandt	is	using	the
term	“castle”	to	emphasize	how	elaborate	the	firm’s	offices	were.]

**Yes,	 their	 offices	 were	 really	 attractive;	 it	 was	 like	 walking	 through	 a
beautiful	 gallery.	 [I	 worked	 for	 Commodities	 Corporation	 as	 a	 research
analyst.]**

Oh,	it	was	fabulous!

**Do	you	remember	anything	about	the	interview	process?**

The	traders	were	all	quirky.	They	were	academic	types—a	big	contrast	from	the
kinds	of	traders	I	was	used	to	on	the	Board	of	Trade.

**How	much	money	did	they	give	you	to	manage?**

They	gave	me	$100,000	to	start,	but	they	raised	it	to	$1	million	and	eventually	to
more	than	$5	million.

**What	was	your	experience	trading	for	Commodities	Corporation?**

My	major	problem	was	that	I	was	never	very	good	at	trading	size.	It	made	me
nervous	 to	 trade	 more	 than	 100	 bonds	 at	 a	 time.	 I	 remember	 the	 first	 time	 I
entered	a	100-contract	order.	I	was	shaking.	It	freaked	me	out.	I	don’t	think	I
ever	got	over	that.

**How	many	years	into	managing	the	Commodities	Corporation	account	was
it	before	you	started	trading	position	sizes	as	large	as	100	bonds?**

About	three	years.

**Did	trading	larger	size	impact	your	performance?**

It	did.

**In	what	way?**

It	made	me	more	timid.	If	you	have	a	100-contract	position,	and	the	market	goes
against	you	by	a	full	point,	that’s	$100,000.	I	started	thinking	in	terms	of	dollars.
I	 stopped	 trading	 the	 market	 and	 started	 trading	 my	 equity.	 It	 had	 a	 definite
impact	on	my	trading,	and	my	performance	drastically	deteriorated,	beginning


around	1991.	I	see	this	all	so	much	more	clearly	today.	I	don’t	think	I	was	as
aware	of	what	was	happening	at	the	time,	but	when	I	look	back	at	it	today,	I
understand	what	happened.

**How	did	the	Commodities	Corporation	relationship	end?**

By	1992,	my	trading	was	trailing	off,	and	I	was	not	meeting	their	benchmarks.

**But	hadn’t	you	done	very	well	for	Commodities	Corporation	overall?**

I	had.	And	it	wasn’t	like	I	had	any	substantial	losses.	It	was	more	a	matter	of	my
performance	dropping	to	near	breakeven,	give	or	take	a	few	percent.	I	also	had
cut	 down	 my	 trading	 size,	 and	 I	 wasn’t	 using	 most	 of	 my	 allocation.	 Their
attitude	was,	“What,	you	have	a	$10	million	account,	and	you’re	trading	only	20-
lot	positions?”

**Did	Commodities	Corporation	terminate	your	trading	account,	or	did	you
leave	on	your	own	volition?**

It	was	more	of	a	mutual	decision.	I	didn’t	have	the	sharp	edge	I	had	in	previous
years.

**Did	you	still	continue	trading	your	account?**

Yes,	for	another	two	years.

**Did	 you	 feel	 better	 once	 you	 didn’t	 have	 the	 burden	 of	 managing	 the
Commodities	Corporation	account?**

No,	I	wasn’t	feeling	good	about	myself	as	a	trader.	The	fun	of	trading	had	left
me	at	that	point.	Trading	had	become	drudgery.	I	was	feeling	the	discrepancy
between	how	I	was	performing	and	how	I	knew	I	could	perform.	That	gap	was
emotionally	difficult	for	me	to	live	with.

**Why	was	that	gap	there?**

Oh,	I	think	it	was	because	I	had	become	gun-shy.	I	felt	like	I	had	lost	my	edge,
and	I	didn’t	know	how	to	get	it	back.

**But	wasn’t	there	some	sense	of	relief	in	not	having	to	trade	the	Commodities
Corporation	account?**

The	more	significant	relief	was	in	not	having	to	trade	my	own	account.

**Besides	relief,	how	did	you	feel	the	day	you	closed	your	own	account?**

There	were	lots	of	feelings.	Part	of	it	was,	“Thank	God	this	is	done.”	Part	of	it
was,	“I’m	admitting	failure.”	At	the	end	of	the	day,	I	was	tapping	out.	How	was	I
different	from	any	other	guy	tapping	out	on	the	Board	of	Trade?

**When	did	you	get	back	into	trading?**


Eleven	years	later,	in	2006.	I	remember	the	exact	time	and	place.	I	was	sitting	at
my	 desk,	 my	 wife,	 Mona,	 was	 standing	 on	 my	 left	 side,	 and	 the	 thought	 of
trading	fluttered	back	into	my	mind.	I	turned	to	Mona	and	said,	“What	do	you
think	about	me	getting	back	into	commodity	trading?”	She	did	not	like	the	idea.

**I	guess	because	the	last	few	years	of	trading	had	been	so	miserable	for	you.**

She	remembered	those	years.	She	said,	“Really,	you	want	to	do	that	again?”	I
said,	“I	have	to	do	it.”	I	opened	an	account	shortly	afterward.

**You	stopped	trading	in	1995	and	restarted	in	2006.	In	all	those	intervening
years,	did	you	pay	any	attention	to	the	markets?**

I	didn’t	have	a	futures	account.

**You	didn’t	even	look	at	a	chart?**

I	didn’t	even	have	any	charting	software.

**So	for	11	years,	you	didn’t	even	look	at	a	chart.	Then	you	abruptly	decided
to	start	trading	again.	Was	there	a	catalyst?**

I	think	I	missed	it.	Also,	part	of	it	was	that	trading	had	ended	badly.	The	way	it
ended	 started	 to	 stick	 in	 my	 craw.	 I	 thought,	 “Peter,	 you	 can’t	 let	 the	 way	 it
ended	be	the	last	word.”

**What	happened	after	you	started	trading	again?**

I	 had	 been	 away	 from	 trading	 so	 long,	 I	 wasn’t	 aware	 that	 the	 world	 had
transitioned	 to	 electronic	 trading.	 I	 even	 remember	 getting	 my	 time	 stamp
machine	out	of	the	closet	and	printing	a	bunch	of	order	tickets.	[He	laughs	at
how	archaic	these	actions	were.]	I	didn’t	know	whether	what	I	used	to	do,	chart
analysis,	 was	 even	 going	 to	 work	 anymore.	 I	 had	 a	 few	 good	 trades	 when	 I
started	trading,	and	it	seemed	that	the	charts	were	still	working.	I	liked	that.	I	had
two	really,	really	good	years.

**Psychologically,	were	you	back	to	where	you	were?**

Yes,	I	was	really	enjoying	it.

**Your	second	trading	career	has	gone	very	well,	but	you	had	one	losing	year,
which	stands	in	extreme	contrast	to	all	the	other	years	since	you	resumed
trading.	[In	2013,	Brandt	was	down	13%	compared	with	an	average	annual
return	of	49%	in	the	other	years	during	the	2007–2019	period.	His	second-
worst	year	during	this	period	was	a	gain	of	16%.]	Was	there	something
different	about	2013?**

Yes,	 there	 was.	 There	 were	 two	 factors	 that	 reinforced	 each	 other.	 First,	 it	 is
probably	 no	 coincidence	 that	 2013	 was	 the	 year	 I	 decided	 to	 accept	 other


people’s	money.

**After	so	many	years	trading	just	your	own	account,	what	prompted	you	to
expand	to	accept	investor	money	as	well?**

People	I	knew	kept	asking	me	to	manage	their	money.	I	was	reluctant	to	do	it,
but,	after	a	while,	the	multiple	requests	wore	me	down,	and	I	thought,	“Yeah,	I’ll
give	it	a	try.”	I	look	back	at	that	decision	today	and	wonder,	“Why	in	the	world
did	I	do	that?”	There	was	no	reason	for	me	to	do	it.

**Why	did	managing	other	people’s	money	cause	you	to	have	your	only	losing
year	since	you	resumed	trading	in	2007,	as	well	as	your	worst	drawdown
since	then?**

The	drawdown	would	have	happened	anyway,	but	I	don’t	think	it	would	have
been	as	deep,	nor	lasted	as	long.	The	perspective	I	have	on	it	now	is	that	when	I
was	trading	my	own	account,	it	was	like	trading	monopoly	money.	My	trading
capital	was	just	something	I	kept	score	with.	I	detached	myself	emotionally	from
it.

**For	most	people,	the	money	in	their	account	is	very	real;	it	certainly	is	not
like	monopoly	money.	How	long	have	you	been	able	to	have	a	detached	view
regarding	the	money	in	your	account?**

Oh,	I	think	that	was	something	I	was	able	to	develop	within	my	first	few	years	of
trading—sometime	back	in	the	1980s.

**I	take	it	that	your	perspective	on	trading	capital	changed	when	you	were
managing	other	people’s	money?**

It	absolutely	did.	Once	I	found	myself	trading	money	for	friends,	all	of	a	sudden,
it	was	real	money.	It	messed	with	my	head.

**How	long	did	you	manage	investor	money?**

I	started	trading	the	first	client	account	in	January	2013,	and	by	June	2014,	I	had
returned	all	the	investor	money.

**How	close	was	June	2014	to	the	bottom	of	your	drawdown?**

It	 _was_ 	the	bottom	of	my	drawdown.	And	I	don’t	believe	that	was	coincidental.	I
think	it	was	the	bottom	because	I	gave	all	the	investor	money	back.

**That	seems	to	imply	that	you	wouldn’t	have	experienced	the	subsequent
large	rebound	in	your	own	account	if	you	hadn’t	given	the	money	back.**

I	think	it	more	than	implies	that;	I	think	it’s	true.	I	believe	if	I	hadn’t	returned
investor	money,	I	would	have	just	dug	the	hole	deeper.

**What	was	the	trigger	for	your	finally	deciding	to	return	investor	money?**


I	am	fortunate	that	I	have	trading	peers	I	can	speak	to	who	will	be	honest	with
me.	They	knew	what	I	was	going	through,	and	they	understood	that	managing
other	 people’s	 money	 was	 messing	 up	 my	 trading.	 Their	 advice	 was	 that	 I
needed	to	return	investor	money	and	go	back	to	trading	just	my	own	account	the
way	I	used	to.

**By	 that	 point,	 weren’t	 you	 already	 aware	 that	 managing	 other	 people’s
money	was	messing	with	your	mental	trading	state?**

On	some	level,	I	knew	what	the	problem	was,	but	I	had	trouble	admitting	it	to
myself.	I	was	avoiding	having	to	go	back	to	investors	when	their	accounts	were
down	and	tell	them	that	I	was	returning	their	money	because	I	couldn’t	make
money	for	them.

**What	was	the	percentage	loss	in	your	investor	accounts	by	the	time	they
closed?**

I	think	the	worst	account	loss	was	around	10%.

**But	your	own	percentage	loss	during	that	period	was	larger.**

That	was	because	I	traded	my	own	account	more	aggressively	than	the	investor
accounts.

**Earlier,	 you	 said	 two	 factors	 were	 different	 in	 2013.	 Managing	 investor
money	was	the	first.	What	was	the	second?**

I	tend	to	be	rule-based	once	I	get	into	a	trade,	but	my	trade	entry	decisions	are
discretionary.	 There	 are	 periods	 when	 there	 are	 lots	 of	 false	 breakouts	 and
whipsaw	price	moves,	and	the	markets	don’t	care	what	the	charts	say.	That	is	an
example	of	my	approach	being	out	of	sync	with	the	markets.	But	there	can	also
be	periods	where	I	am	out	of	sync	with	my	approach.	I	am	not	being	disciplined.
I’m	not	being	patient.	I’m	jumping	the	gun	on	trades.	I’m	taking	positions	before
the	market	confirms	them.	I’m	taking	trades	on	inferior	patterns.	And,	of	course,
you	can	have	periods	where	both	conditions	exist:	My	methodology	is	out	of
sync	with	the	markets,	and	I	am	out	of	sync	with	my	methodology.	That	was
2013	through	mid-2014.

At	 the	 time,	 CTAs	 were	 all	 tanking.	 [CTAs	 stand	 for	 Commodity	 Trading

Advisors,	the	legal	term	for	registered	managers	in	the	futures	markets.^5 ]	There
was	lots	of	talk	suggesting	market	behavior	had	changed	and	that	to	survive	as	a
trader,	you	had	to	change.	And	I	drank	the	Kool-Aid.	I	started	tweaking	what	I
do.

**In	what	way?**


I	 added	 indicators.	 I	 tried	 mean	 reversion	 trades.	 [Mean	 reversion	 trades	 are
trades	in	which	you	sell	on	strength	and	buy	on	weakness.]

**But	mean	reversion	is	the	exact	opposite	of	what	you	do.**

Exactly.	 [He	 says	 this	 in	 a	 drawn-out	 singsong	 fashion.]	 Out	 of	 desperation,
because	 nothing	 was	 working,	 I	 kept	 on	 trying	 different	 things.	 It	 became	 a
vicious	 cycle.	 So	 what	 might	 have	 been	 a	 standard	 three-	 or	 four-month
drawdown	with	a	loss	of	5%	turned	into	an	18-month	drawdown	of	17%.	The
losing	period	lasted	much	longer	than	it	should	have	because	I	went	down	the
rabbit	trail.

**Would	you	have	started	changing	the	way	you	trade	if	you	hadn’t	been
managing	investor	money	during	this	drawdown?**

Not	a	chance.

**We	 talked	 about	 your	 account	 rebounding	 after	 you	 returned	 investor
money.	Was	there	anything	else	behind	this	performance	turnaround?**

I	had	bought	into	the	lie	that	I	had	to	change	because	the	old	ways	no	longer
worked.	I	finally	realized	I	had	to	get	back	to	basics.	My	thought	process	went
something	like	this:	“I’m	jumping	from	one	approach	to	another.	I’m	grasping	at
straws.	I	don’t	even	know	where	I	am.	If	I’m	going	down,	I’m	going	down	doing
what	I	know	how	to	do.”

**What	 happened	 after	 you	 went	 back	 to	 trading	 your	 standard
methodology?**

I	had	a	great	year,	but	I	had	favorable	markets.

**Did	 the	 2013–14	 drawdown	 experience	 change	 anything	 for	 you	 besides
knowing	you	never	wanted	to	manage	outside	money	and	cementing	your
conviction	to	sticking	with	your	methodology?**

After	the	2013–14	drawdown,	I	started	looking	at	my	equity	in	a	different	way.
Before	then,	I	looked	at	the	total	equity	in	my	account,	including	open	trades.
That	is	the	conventional	way	of	looking	at	equity	and,	of	course,	the	way	the	IRS
looks	at	equity.	But	now,	I	don’t	want	to	know	my	open	trade	equity.	So	I	graph
my	equity	based	on	closed	trades	only.

**What	difference	does	that	make	to	you	psychologically?**

In	reality,	open	trade	profits	aren’t	mine.	They	don’t	belong	to	me.	So	it	doesn’t
matter	if	I	lose	it.	Therefore,	it	makes	it	easier	for	me	to	allow	a	market	to	come
back	against	me	somewhat.

**So	even	though	your	initial	stop	points	are	very	close,	once	you	are	ahead,**


**you	give	the	market	more	latitude.**

Much	more	latitude.	Also,	once	the	profits	of	the	trade	equal	1%	of	my	equity,	I
take	half	the	position	off.	Then	I	can	give	the	other	half	much	more	room.

**Will	you	still	raise	the	stop	on	the	remaining	half	of	the	position?**

I	will,	but	much	less	aggressively.	However,	once	I	get	to	more	than	70%	of	my
target	objective,	I	will	jam	my	stop.	That	part	of	my	trading	methodology	goes
back	to	my	days	of	popcorn	trades.	If	I	have	an	open	profit	of	$1800	per	contract
on	a	trade	with	a	target	of	$2000,	why	would	I	risk	giving	it	all	back	to	make	the
extra	$200?	So	when	the	trade	gets	close	to	the	target,	I	will	raise	the	stop.

**When	you	get	to	within	30%	of	your	target,	how	do	you	decide	where	to
raise	the	stop	to?**

Once	it	gets	to	that	point,	I	will	use	a	mechanical	three-day	stop	rule.

**Exactly	what	is	that	rule?**

Assuming	a	long	position,	the	first	day	would	be	the	high	day	of	the	move.	The
second	day	would	be	the	day	the	market	closed	below	the	low	of	the	high	day.
The	third	day	would	be	the	day	the	market	closed	below	the	low	of	the	second
day.	I	would	get	out	on	the	close	of	the	third	day.

**I	assume	those	three	days	would	not	have	to	be	consecutive.**

That’s	correct.	The	third	day	could	be	two	weeks	after	the	first	day.	I	developed
the	three-day	stop	rule	not	because	I	thought	it	was	the	best	rule—in	fact,	I’m
sure	it’s	not—but	rather	because,	as	a	discretionary	trader,	I	hate	indecision.	I
hate	 regret.	 I	 hate	 second-guessing.	 So	 I	 wanted	 to	 develop	 a	 rule	 that	 was
automatic	and	would	protect	against	my	giving	back	most	of	my	open	profits.

**Your	initial	risk	on	the	trade	is	about	1/2%	of	your	equity.	How	far	away	is
your	target?**

A	point	equivalent	to	about	2%	of	my	equity.

**And	if	it	reaches	that	point,	will	you	just	take	profits	on	the	entire	position?**

Usually,	I	will	just	take	the	profits.	There	may	be	occasional	exceptions	where	I
will	use	a	very	close	stop	instead,	especially	for	short	positions,	because	markets
can	collapse	much	more	quickly	than	they	rise.

**At	what	point	would	you	look	to	re-enter	the	trade	after	you	take	profits?**

I	don’t	look	to	re-enter.	It	has	to	be	a	brand-new	trade.

**What	about	markets	that	just	keep	on	trending?**

I	will	miss	most	of	those	trends.	I	feel	more	comfortable	playing	between	the	30-


yard	lines	than	trying	to	run	a	kickoff	from	the	10-yard	line	to	the	end	zone.	I
will	miss	some	huge	moves.

**Well,	your	methodology	precludes	you	from	remotely	catching	the	major
portion	of	those	trends.**

It	does.

**Do	you	trade	stocks	the	same	way	you	trade	futures?**

I	trade	them	exactly	the	same.

**Don’t	you	think	there	is	any	difference	between	the	chart	behavior	of	stocks
and	futures?**

No.

**I’m	 surprised	 because	 my	 impression	 has	 always	 been	 that	 stocks	 are
subject	to	much	more	erratic	price	behavior	than	futures.**

I	think	that’s	true,	but	when	stocks	get	on	a	run,	they	act	the	same.

**I	have	seen	you	refer	to	an	“ice	line”	in	one	of	your	letters.	What	exactly	is
an	ice	line?**

When	I	lived	in	Minnesota,	we	lived	on	a	lake,	and	the	lake	would	freeze	over.
The	ice	would	support	you,	but	if	you	ever	fell	through,	the	ice	would	act	as
resistance.	The	analogy	for	price	charts	is	that	the	ice	line	is	that	price	area	that	is
difficult	to	get	through,	but	once	you	do,	it	should	provide	support.	If	I	can	find	a
market	with	a	price	breakout	where	at	least	half	of	that	day’s	range	is	below	the
ice	line,	then	that	low	can	serve	as	a	significant	risk	point.

**What	if	less	than	half	of	the	day’s	price	range	is	below	the	ice	line—could
you	use	the	low	of	the	previous	day?**

That’s	what	I	do.

**It	seems	like	it	would	be	so	common	for	the	low	of	the	entry	day	price	bar	to
be	taken	out	without	any	consequence	on	the	long-term	chart	picture.	I
totally	 get	 the	 concept	 that	 keeping	 your	 risk	 very	 low	 is	 an	 essential
component	 of	 your	 success,	 but	 have	 you	 ever	 done	 the	 research	 to	 see
whether	your	risk	is	actually	too	low?	For	example,	might	you	be	better	off
risking	the	low	of	a	few	bars	rather	than	just	a	single	one?**

Yes,	I	have	done	that	research.	I	found	that	if	I	gave	the	market	a	little	more
breathing	 room	 in	 the	 early	 days	 of	 a	 trade,	 over	 time,	 I	 would	 make	 more
profits.	So,	if	my	goal	were	to	make	the	highest	return,	I	would	use	a	wider	stop.
However,	 my	 goal	 is	 not	 to	 maximize	 my	 return	 but	 rather	 to	 maximize	 my
profit	factor.	[The	profit	factor	is	a	return/risk	measure	that	is	defined	as	the	sum


of	all	winning	trades	divided	by	the	sum	of	all	losing	trades.]

**Do	you	ever	use	a	trailing	stop?	[A	trailing	stop	is	an	order	to	exit	the
position	whenever	the	market	moves	a	fixed	amount	below	the	high	of	a
price	upmove	(or	above	the	low	of	a	price	downmove).]**

Never.	When	I	hear	people	say	something	like,	“I’m	going	to	use	a	$500	trailing
stop,”	I	think,	“What	sense	does	that	make!	You	mean	you	want	to	be	selling
when	you	should	be	buying	more?”	That	never	made	any	sense	to	me.	Nor	does
it	make	any	sense	to	me	that	some	people	use	their	open	profits	on	the	trade	to
add	more	contracts.	That,	to	me,	is	the	most	asinine	trading	idea	I	ever	heard.	If
you	 do	 that,	 you	 can	 be	 right	 on	 the	 trade	 and	 still	 lose	 money.	 In	 my	 own
trading,	my	positions	only	get	smaller.	My	biggest	position	is	the	day	I	put	a
trade	on.

**What	is	the	weekend	rule	I’ve	seen	you	refer	to?**

The	weekend	rule	goes	back	to	Richard	Donchian	in	the	1970s	and	basically
says	that	if	the	market	closes	in	new	high	or	low	ground	on	a	Friday,	then	it	is
likely	to	extend	that	move	on	Monday	and	early	Tuesday.	The	significance	for
me	is	that	if	a	market	breaks	out	on	a	Friday,	then	I	have	a	completed	pattern	and
the	Donchian	rule	working	in	favor	of	the	trade.

**Have	you	ever	checked	out	the	validity	of	the	weekend	rule?**

I	have	never	statistically	analyzed	it,	but	I	can	tell	you	that	many	of	my	most
profitable	 trades	 came	 from	 Friday	 breakouts,	 especially	 if	 it	 is	 a	 three-day
weekend.	I	can	also	tell	you	that	the	trades	that	I	stayed	in	despite	showing	a	net
loss	as	of	the	Friday	close	probably	cost	me	more	money	than	any	other	type	of
trade.	I	have	learned	that	it	is	best	to	liquidate	any	trade	that	shows	an	open	loss
as	of	the	Friday	close.

**Why	do	you	think	that	rule	works?**

The	Friday	close	is	the	most	critical	price	of	the	week	because	it	is	the	price	at
which	 people	 commit	 to	 accepting	 the	 risk	 of	 holding	 a	 position	 over	 the
weekend.

**Do	you	now	unfailingly	adhere	to	the	Friday	rule?**

I	sometimes	violate	it,	but	when	I	do,	the	market	usually	slaps	me	in	the	face.
The	one	thing	I	regret	is	not	keeping	data	on	different	types	of	trading	decisions.

**The	way	you	trade	with	such	tight	risk	control	from	the	point	of	entry
seems	like	you	wouldn’t	be	exposed	to	any	substantial	losing	trades,	but
were	there	any	particularly	painful	trades	in	your	career?**


Oh	yeah.	I	was	long	crude	oil	in	January	1991	when	the	US	began	its	attack
against	Iraq	in	the	First	Gulf	War.	Before	the	news	of	the	attack	came	out,	crude
oil	closed	around	$29	in	New	York.	Although	this	was	before	24-hour	markets,
crude	did	trade	on	the	Kerb	[an	after-hours	market	in	London]	and	was	trading
about	$2–$3	higher	that	night.	So	I	went	to	sleep	thinking,	“Boy,	tomorrow	is
really	going	to	be	something.”	Well,	it	was,	but	not	the	way	I	thought.	The	next
day,	 crude	 oil	 opened	 $7	 below	 the	 New	 York	 close—a	 $10	 swing	 from	 its
nighttime	levels.	That	was	by	far	the	largest	loss	on	a	trade	I	ever	experienced.
[Another	account	of	a	trading	experience	related	to	this	same	stunning	market

reversal	came	up	in	my	interview	with	Tom	Basso	in	 _The	New	Market	Wizards_.^6 ]

**With	the	market	gapping	so	much	lower	on	the	open,	did	you	still	get	out	at
the	open,	or	did	you	wait	before	liquidating	your	position?**

I	 don’t	 sit	 and	 speculate	 with	 a	 loss.	 I	 learned	 a	 long	 time	 ago	 that	 if	 you
speculate	 with	 a	 loss	 to	 get	 less	 of	 a	 loss,	 you	 end	 up	 with	 more	 of	 a	 loss.
[Notwithstanding	the	massive	decline	on	that	day,	the	crude	oil	market	moved
significantly	lower	the	next	day	and	didn’t	reach	a	low	until	about	a	month	later.]
The	same	trading	discipline	applies	to	an	error.	I	have	never	speculated	with	an
error.

**How	much	did	you	lose	on	that	single	trade?**

About	14%	of	my	equity.

**Do	you	remember	your	emotional	response?**

Shock.	I	was	numb.

**What	is	your	motivation	for	writing	a	weekly	market	letter?	It	seems	like	a
lot	of	work.**

Quite	frankly,	the	 _Factor_ 	is	written	for	an	audience	of	one.	I	write	the	 _Factor_ 	for
me.	It	is	my	way	of	preaching	to	myself	all	the	things	I	need	to	be	continually
reminded	of.

**Don’t	you	have	any	concern	that	by	publicizing	your	trades,	there	may	be
too	many	trades	put	in	at	the	same	price	points,	thereby	adversely	affecting
the	trade?**

Nah,	I	don’t	think	it	has	any	effect.

**I	know	you	do	almost	all	your	chart	analysis	and	trading	decisions	for	the
coming	 week	 after	 the	 Friday	 close	 and	 up	 through	 the	 Sunday	 night
opening.	Do	you	make	any	new	trading	decisions	during	the	week?**

By	the	end	of	the	weekend,	I	have	my	list	of	markets	to	monitor	for	a	trade.	On


rare	occasions,	I	may	add	a	market	during	the	week,	but	I	try	to	minimize	such
trades.	If	it’s	not	on	my	weekend	list	of	markets	to	monitor	for	the	week	for	a
potential	trade,	then	I	don’t	like	to	take	it	as	a	trade.	This	is	another	example	of	a
category	of	trades	that	I	wished	I	had	kept	data	on.	I	bet	if	you	counted	up	all	the
trades	I	ever	did	that	were	not	on	my	weekend	list	of	potential	trades,	they	would
be	net	losers.

**Do	you	trade	intraday	at	all?**

For	the	first	two	or	three	days	after	I	put	on	a	trade,	I	am	alert	for	an	opportunity
to	 tighten	 my	 stop,	 even	 intraday.	 But	 with	 that	 one	 exception,	 I	 don’t	 trade
intraday.	If	I	sit	and	watch	the	computer	screen	all	day,	I	will	sabotage	myself.
Inevitably,	I	will	make	the	wrong	decisions.	I	will	get	out	of	winning	trades.	I’ll
second-guess	an	order	that	I	placed	when	the	markets	weren’t	open,	and	I	made	a
decision	based	strictly	on	the	charts	rather	than	being	mesmerized	by	blinking
prices	 on	 the	 screen.	 For	 me,	 what	 works	 is	 a	 disciplined	 approach:	 Make	 a
decision,	write	the	order,	place	the	order,	and	live	with	it.

**Your	comments	about	how	making	decisions	during	market	hours	tends	to
mess	up	your	trading	reminds	me	of	an	interchange	I	had	with	Ed	Seykota.
I	remarked,	“I	noticed	there	is	no	quote	machine	on	your	desk.”	He	replied,
“Having	a	quote	machine	is	like	having	a	slot	machine	on	your	desk—you**

**end	up	feeding	it	all	day	long.”**^7

The	next	morning,	we	continued	the	interview	over	breakfast	at	a	place	called
the	 _Black	 Watch_ .	 (Excellent	 breakfast	 spot;	 check	 it	 out	 if	 you	 are	 ever	 in
Tucson.)	Brandt	began	the	conversation	by	saying	that	although	he	had	done	all
right,	he	was	not	in	the	same	league	as	some	of	the	great	traders	in	the	other
_Market	Wizards_ books.	 He	 started	 rattling	 off	 a	 string	 of	 names	 to	 make	 his
point.	Brandt	concluded	by	saying	that	if	I	decided	not	to	include	him	in	the
book,	 he	 would	 fully	 understand,	 and	 it	 would	 be	 OK	 with	 him.	 Brandt	 is	 a
sincere	person,	so	he	was	not	speaking	out	of	false	modesty—although	it	was
certainly	 misplaced	 modesty.	 I	 told	 Brandt	 there	 was	 no	 chance	 that	 I	 would
exclude	him	from	the	book.	I	explained	that	he	not	only	had	a	long	track	record
with	superb	performance,	but	he	also	had	a	lot	of	valuable	insights	about	trading
that	I	thought	were	important	to	share	with	readers.	Brandt	had	brought	some
charts	 along	 to	 illustrate	 certain	 of	 his	 past	 trades,	 which	 is	 where	 our


conversation	continued.

This	was	my	most	profitable	trade	ever.	It	broke	out,	and	never	looked	back.
[Brandt	hands	me	a	chart	of	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	Composite	Index,
pointing	to	his	long	side	entry	in	early	1987	on	a	breakout	above	an	extended,
horizontal	 consolidation—a	 breakout	 that	 led	 to	 an	 immediate	 and	 virtually
unbroken	upside	move.]

Here	is	a	big	trade	I	had	in	2008	when	the	pound	crashed	from	$2.00	to	$1.40	in
a	matter	of	months.	Again,	the	market	broke	out	and	never	looked	back.	[In	the
chart	he	hands	me,	the	downside	breakout	of	a	head-and-shoulders	consolidation
formed	at	the	highs	leads	to	a	sudden,	huge	decline,	interrupted	only	briefly	by	a
minor	 rebound	 after	 the	 initial	 downswing.	 He	 comments	 on	 that	 minor
rebound.]	What	I	have	found	is	that	when	you	have	a	big	move	down,	the	first
rally	never	holds.	If	there	is	ever	a	case	where	I	want	to	sell	into	strength,	it
would	be	the	first	rally	after	a	straight-line	drop.	Often	the	rally	will	last	for	only
two	 days	 after	 the	 reversal	 day.	 [He	 shows	 me	 some	 other	 similar	 charts	 of
breakouts	from	long-term	consolidations	leading	to	major	price	moves.]

**In	all	these	examples,	you	are	buying	or	selling	after	breakouts	from	long-
term	 consolidations.	 Do	 you	 ever	 enter	 trades	 after	 breakouts	 from
pennants	or	flags?	[Pennants	and	flags	are	narrow,	short-term	(generally
under	two	weeks)	consolidations	that	form	after	price	swings.]**

I	will	if	they	form	during	a	big	price	move	that	has	a	much	further	objective
based	on	the	completion	of	a	pattern	on	the	weekly	chart.	But	if	they	just	happen
on	any	chart,	the	answer	would	be	no.

**I	remember	once	retweeting	one	of	your	market	observations	and	receiving
a	comment	along	the	lines:	“Why	would	you	pay	any	attention	to	someone
like	Brandt	who	recommended	going	short	the	S&P	5,000	points	lower?”
What	is	your	reaction	to	that	type	of	comment?**

My	philosophy	is	strong	opinions,	weakly	held.	The	minute	a	trade	reaches	into
my	pocket,	it	becomes	a	weakly	held	position,	and	I’ll	drop	it	like	a	hot	potato.	I
can	go	from	a	strong	opinion	to	being	out	of	the	market	in	one	day.	But	in	the
Twitter	world,	all	they	remember	is	the	strong	opinion.	It’s	like	whatever	you
say,	 it	 represents	 your	 opinion	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 your	 life.	 They	 remember	 the
recommendation,	but	they	forget	that	I	was	out	a	day	or	two	later	with	a	50-basis


point	loss	or,	for	that	matter,	a	50-basis	point	gain.	In	the	Twitter	world,	there	is	a
tendency	to	respond	negatively	if	you	were	bullish	and	now	switch	to	bearish	or
vice	versa.	Whereas,	I	think	that	the	flexibility	to	change	your	mind	is	actually	a
strong	attribute	for	a	trader.

**The	markets	have	seen	such	enormous	changes	during	your	trading	career.
We’ve	gone	from	a	time	when	you	needed	a	mainframe	the	size	of	a	room	to
develop	and	test	simple	trading	systems	to	current	enormous	computing
power	and	easy	access	to	trading	software.	We	have	gone	from	virtually	no
computerized	trading	to	vast	amounts	of	computerized	trading.	We	have
seen	 the	 advent	 of	 trading	 based	 on	 artificial	 intelligence	 and	 high-
frequency	trading.	We	have	gone	from	a	time	when	technical	analysis	was
considered	 an	 arcane	 backwater	 in	 market	 analysis	 to	 a	 time	 when
technical-based	 trading—both	 chart	 analysis	 of	 the	 type	 you	 do	 and
computerized	technical	systems—is	widespread.	Despite	all	these	changes,
you	are	using	the	same	techniques	you	did	at	the	beginning	of	your	trading
career	based	on	chart	patterns	described	in	detail	nearly	90	years	ago	in
Schabacker’s	book.	Do	you	think	these	techniques	still	work,	despite	all
these	changes?**

No,	they	do	not.	They	absolutely	do	not.

**How	 then	 have	 you	 been	 able	 to	 continue	 to	 be	 successful	 using
methodologies	that	come	from	such	a	different	time?**

I	have	thought	a	lot	about	that	question.	If	I	were	to	take	trades	at	every	chart
pattern	 entry	 point	 Schabacker	 would	 have	 labeled,	 it	 would	 be	 extremely
difficult	 to	 make	 money	 because	 markets	 no	 longer	 obey	 all	 of	 the	 patterns.
There	was	a	time	when	you	could	just	trade	the	chart	patterns,	and	you	would
make	money.	I	believe	that	edge	is	gone.

**So,	you	believe	that	classical	chart	analysis	on	its	own	no	longer	works.**

Yes,	I	believe	that	is	true.	Large	long-term	patterns	no	longer	work.	Trendlines
no	 longer	 work.	 Channels	 no	 longer	 work.	 Symmetrical	 triangles	 no	 longer
work.

**So	what,	if	anything,	does	still	work?**

The	only	thing	I	have	found	that	still	works	are	patterns	that	tend	to	be	shorter-
term—less	than	a	year	and	preferably	less	than	26	weeks—that	have	a	horizontal
boundary.	Such	patterns	could	include	head-and-shoulder	formations,	ascending
and	descending	triangles,	and	rectangular	consolidations.

**Is	it	that	the	patterns	you	are	naming	are	not	so	much	patterns	that	work,**


**but	instead	are	patterns	that	allow	you	to	select	entry	points	that	have	well-
defined,	reasonably	close,	meaningful	stop-risk	points?**

Yes,	charts	will	give	you	the	idea	of	the	path	of	least	resistance,	but	charts	do	not
forecast.	 There	 is	 a	 danger	 when	 people	 start	 thinking	 of	 charts	 in	 terms	 of
forecasting.	 Charts	 are	 wonderful	 in	 finding	 specific	 spots	 for	 asymmetric
risk/reward	trades.	That’s	it.	I	am	focused	on	the	probability	of	being	able	to	get
out	of	the	trade	at	breakeven	or	better	rather	than	on	the	probability	of	getting	an
anticipated	price	move.	For	example,	I’m	short	gold	now.	I’m	looking	for	the
possibility	of	a	$60	to	$70	decline	in	gold.	If	someone	were	to	ask	me,	“How
confident	are	you	about	getting	a	$60	to	$70	decline	in	gold?”	that	would	be	the
wrong	question.	The	right	question	would	be,	“How	confident	are	you	that	you
will	be	able	to	get	out	of	the	trade	not	much	worse	than	breakeven?”

**You	are	using	a	trade	signaling	methodology	that	you	acknowledge	doesn’t
have	much	of	an	edge.	So	what	is	your	edge?**

It	isn’t	the	charts	that	give	me	my	edge;	it’s	risk	management.	I	get	an	edge	from
discipline,	patience,	and	order	execution.	A	reader	of	my	 _Factor_ 	weekly	letter
said,	“Peter,	you	get	your	edge	because	you	are	willing	to	watch	a	market	for
weeks	before	entering	and	then	be	out	by	the	end	of	the	day	because	the	market
didn’t	 act	 right.”	 And	 I	 thought,	 “My	 God,	 someone	 here	 gets	 me.”	 All	 that
charts	do	is	give	me	a	point	at	which	I’m	willing	to	take	a	bet.	They	give	me	a
point	 at	 which	 I	 can	 say,	 “The	 market	 should	 trend	 from	 this	 exact	 price.”
Another	way	to	look	at	it	is:	Can	I	find	a	bar	on	the	price	chart	where	there	is	a
pretty	good	chance	that	the	low	of	that	bar	will	not	be	taken	out?

**So,	it	isn’t	that	you	figured	out	where	to	enter	trades	so	much	as	you	figured
out	where	you	can	place	asymmetrical	trades	that	have	a	near-50-50	chance
of	working.**

I	think	that’s	a	good	description.	All	my	profits	come	from	10%–15%	of	my
trades;	 all	 the	 other	 trades	 are	 throwaways.	 The	 same	 pattern	 seems	 to	 hold
consistently	year	in	and	year	out.	The	problem,	of	course,	is	that	I	never	know
which	trades	are	going	to	be	in	that	10%–15%.

**I	know	your	trading	falls	entirely	in	the	camp	of	technical	analysis,	but	do
you	think	there	is	any	value	in	fundamental	analysis,	even	if	it’s	not	the
right	approach	for	you?**

Dan	Markey,	my	mentor,	had	an	interesting	philosophy	about	fundamentals.	He
thought	 most	 fundamental	 news	 was	 nonsense.	 Dan	 had	 what	 he	 called	 the
dominant	 fundamental	 factor	 theory,	 which	 postulated	 that,	 over	 an	 extended


period,	one	to	five	years,	there	was	one	underlying	fundamental	factor	that	was
the	driver	of	the	market.	All	the	other	news	merely	caused	gyrations	around	the
trend	 driven	 by	 the	 dominant	 fundamental	 factor,	 and,	 more	 often	 than	 not,
conventional	 wisdom	 didn’t	 have	 a	 clue	 about	 what	 the	 relevant	 fundamental
factor	was.	You	could	watch	CNBC	for	a	week,	and	they	would	never	mention
the	dominant	fundamental	factor.	In	fact,	if	people	were	aware	of	the	dominant
factor	 at	 all,	 in	 most	 instances,	 they	 were	 trying	 to	 fade	 it.	 I	 think	 a	 great
example	of	this	tendency	was	quantitative	easing,	which	was	implemented	in	the
aftermath	of	the	Great	Recession	and	was	the	great	driver	of	the	ensuing	bull
market	in	stocks.	People	were	saying,	“The	central	banks	can’t	keep	doing	this.
It’s	causing	too	much	debt.	You	have	to	short	this	market.”

**Do	you	use	Dan’s	concept	at	all?**

I	don’t,	but	I	often	wonder	what	Dan,	who	died	in	1998,	would	have	thought	was
driving	a	given	market.

**What	advice	would	you	give	to	someone	who	wanted	to	pursue	a	trading
career?**

The	first	thing	I	would	ask	them	is,	“If	you	lost	everything	you	put	in,	would	it
meaningfully	 change	 your	 lifestyle?”	 If	 it	 would,	 don’t	 trade.	 If	 you’re	 not	 a
good	problem	solver,	don’t	trade.	If	you	feel	you	need	to	have	trading	profits
accrue	on	some	regular	schedule,	don’t	trade.	The	markets	are	not	an	annuity.	I
would	tell	would-be	traders	to	expect	it	to	take	at	least	three	years	to	get	even	a
clue	of	how	they	should	trade	and	five	years	to	reach	some	level	of	competency.
And	if	you	don’t	have	the	three	to	five	years	to	achieve	trading	competency,	you
probably	 shouldn’t	 trade.	 People	 totally	 underestimate	 how	 long	 it	 takes	 to
become	a	profitable	trader.	Don’t	look	to	become	a	trader	because	you	want	to
make	money.	I	would	say	that	if	your	goal	is	to	earn	a	living	as	a	trader,	the
probability	of	success	is	probably	only	about	1%.

**Do	you	realize	when	I	asked	you	what	advice	you	would	give	to	someone
who	 wanted	 to	 be	 a	 trader,	 you	 just	 gave	 me	 a	 bunch	 of	 reasons	 why
someone	shouldn’t	be	a	trader?**

Oh	yeah.

**If	despite	all	that	advice,	someone	said,	“I	got	you,	but	I	still	want	to	give	it
a	try,”	what	advice	would	you	give	them?**

Learn	not	to	take	a	loss	personally.	The	markets	don’t	care	about	who	you	are.

**What	else?**


You	have	to	find	your	own	way.	If	you	think	you	can	copy	somebody	else’s
trading	style,	it	will	never	work	for	you.

**That	is	one	of	the	main	messages	I	try	to	convey	to	traders	myself,	but	tell
me	in	your	own	words	why	you	think	that	is	true.**

One	of	the	main	dangers	for	traders	who	try	to	mirror	themselves	after	other
traders	 is	 that	 sooner	 or	 later,	 every	 trader	 will	 go	 through	 a	 significant
drawdown.	When	I	go	through	a	challenging	period,	I	understand	it.	If	I	have	10
losing	trades	in	a	row,	I	can	understand	that	I	didn’t	do	anything	wrong	as	long
as	I	followed	my	plan.	Someone	else	trying	to	copy	my	methodology	wouldn’t
have	that	conviction.	If,	as	is	inevitable,	the	approach	went	through	a	difficult
period	at	some	point,	they	wouldn’t	be	able	to	last	through	it.	That’s	why	traders
need	to	know	exactly	why	they	are	taking	a	trade.	That	is	the	only	way	they	will
survive	through	challenging	periods.

**That	raises	the	question	of	what	do	you	do	during	those	periods	where
everything	you	do	seems	to	be	wrong,	and	you	are	just	out	of	sync	with	the
markets?**

I	just	cut	size.	In	the	past,	during	such	times,	I	would	ask,	“What	do	I	need	to
change	in	my	trading?”	That	type	of	response	typically	ended	up	leading	me
down	a	rabbit	trail	that	didn’t	end	well.	Optimizing	your	trading	approach	for	the
last	series	of	trades	is	not	a	solution,	and	it	will	only	lead	you	astray.	I	try	to	keep
trading	the	same	way.	That’s	the	only	way	I’ll	come	out	of	a	drawdown	and	get
back	on	track.

**What	other	advice	would	you	give	to	someone	seeking	a	trading	career?**

You	have	to	learn	to	wait	for	the	right	pitch.	The	hardest	thing	for	me	early	on
was	figuring	out	the	answer	to	the	question:	What	is	my	pitch?	What	is	the	pitch
that	I’m	willing	to	swing	on?	I	think	something	that	every	trader	has	to	come	to
terms	with	is	answering	that	question.	Can	you	define	with	high	specificity	what
trade	 you’re	 willing	 to	 take	 a	 swing	 at?	 Only	 when	 a	 trader	 can	 answer	 that
question	 is	 he	 or	 she	 ready	 to	 deal	 with	 other	 critical	 issues	 such	 as	 sizing,
leverage,	scaling,	and	trade	management.

**Before	you	said,	make	sure	your	motivation	for	becoming	a	trader	is	not	to
make	money.	What	is	a	good	motivation?**

The	 markets	 are	 such	 a	 neat	 challenge.	 You	 have	 to	 enjoy	 the	 process	 of
problem-solving.	I	think	there	is	great	satisfaction	if,	at	the	end	of	it,	you	can	say,
“I	have	found	a	way	to	do	it,	and	I	am	satisfied	with	the	outcome.”

**What	is	your	advice	on	missed	trades?**


Live	 with	 it.	 I	 call	 these	 could’ve-would’ve-should’ve	 trades.	 I	 typically	 am
going	to	have	about	two	pretty	significant	could’ve-would’ve-should’ve	trades
in	an	average	year.	And	I	just	have	to	accept	the	fact	that	it’s	going	to	happen.

**Are	those	trades	more	painful	than	losses?**

They	used	to	be.	They	used	to	drive	me	crazy.	[He	says	this	drawing	out	the	“a”
in	crazy.]

**How	did	you	get	past	that?**

I	reduced	the	number	of	missed	trades	by	planning	and	having	orders	in	place
rather	than	waiting	for	a	breakout	and	then	figuring	out	what	I	was	going	to	do.
Also,	with	experience,	I	have	learned	there’s	always	another	trade	that	will	come
along.	One	of	the	things	that	I	find	amazing	is	that	if	I	wait	long	enough,	there’s
always	 another	 great	 trade	 that	 will	 set	 up.	 I	 am	 more	 concerned	 about	 the
mistakes	I	make	than	the	markets	that	I	miss.

**Contrast	the	characteristics	of	winning	traders	and	losing	traders.**

I	 think	 there	 are	 things	 that	 the	 winners	 have	 in	 common.	 They	 respect	 risk.
They	limit	their	risk	on	a	trade.	They	don’t	automatically	assume	they	will	be
right	on	a	trade.	If	anything,	they	assume	they	will	be	wrong.	They	don’t	get	too
excited	about	a	winning	trade	or	too	bummed	out	about	a	losing	trade.

**And	the	losers?**

They	risk	way	too	much.	They	don’t	have	a	methodology.	They	chase	markets.
They	have	a	fear	of	missing	out.	They	can’t	keep	their	emotions	in	check;	they
have	wild	swings	between	excitement	and	depression.

It	 is	 ironic	 that	 what	 most	 people	 think	 is	 most	 important	 to	 becoming	 a
successful	trader—the	methodology	for	entering	trades—is	actually	one	of	the
least	important	elements	for	Brandt.	In	fact,	Brandt	acknowledges	that	classical
chart	 analysis	 has	 lost	 virtually	 its	 entire	 edge.	 What	 is	 critical	 is	 risk
management.	 In	 fact,	 the	 methodology—chart	 analysis—is	 merely	 a	 tool	 to
identify	 points	 in	 time	 that	 are	 amenable	 to	 the	 execution	 of	 Brandt’s	 risk
management	approach.	Brandt	places	his	stops	to	assure	that	he	never	takes	a
large	 loss	 on	 any	 trade,	 barring	 those	 rare	 circumstances	 where	 his	 stop	 is
executed	far	below	the	intended	level,	as	occurred	in	his	First	Gulf	War	trade—
the	only	such	trade	in	his	career.


The	essence	of	Brandt’s	strategy	is	to	risk	very	little	on	any	given	trade	and	to
restrict	trades	to	those	he	believes	offer	a	reasonable	potential	for	an	objective
that	is	three	to	four	times	the	magnitude	of	his	risk.	He	essentially	uses	charts	to
identify	points	at	which	it	is	possible	to	define	a	close	protective	stop	that	is	also
meaningful—points	at	which	a	relatively	small	price	move	would	be	sufficient	to
trigger	a	meaningful	signal	that	the	trade	is	wrong.

An	example	of	such	a	trade	would	be	going	long	on	a	day	on	which	the	market
closes	strong	after	a	major	upside	breakout,	and	the	low	of	that	day	lies	well
below	the	“ice	line”	to	use	Brandt’s	terminology.	Brandt’s	trading	approach	is
yet	another	example	of	a	common	trait	I	have	observed	among	great	traders:
They	have	a	methodology	based	on	identifying	asymmetric	trade	opportunities
—trades	where	the	perceived	upside	potential	significantly	exceeds	the	required
risk.

Some	readers	may	find	it	puzzling	that	Brandt	chooses	to	use	a	protective	stop
strategy	that	he	acknowledges	is	so	tight	that	it	reduces	his	overall	returns.	Why
not	use	an	approach	that	maximizes	return?	The	answer	is	that	an	approach	that
increases	return	but	also	increases	risk	 _by	a	greater	amount_ 	is	suboptimal.	The
reason	is	that,	mathematically,	by	increasing	position	size,	a	method	with	higher
return-to-risk	can	always	be	made	to	yield	a	higher	return	at	the	same	risk	level
than	a	lower	return-to-risk	method	(even	if	its	return	is	higher).

To	 be	 successful	 as	 a	 trader,	 you	 have	 to	 develop	 your	 own	 trading	 style.
Notably,	while	Brandt’s	primary	mentor	relied	on	fundamental	analysis	and	took
very	long-term	trades,	Brandt	developed	a	trading	methodology	that	was	based
strictly	on	technical	analysis,	taking	trades	of	much	shorter	duration,	particularly
in	 the	 case	 of	 losing	 trades.	 Brandt	 learned	 the	 importance	 of	 money
management	from	his	mentor,	but	the	trading	methodology	he	developed	was
strictly	his	own.

Brandt	has	been	quite	disciplined	about	trading	his	own	methodology	throughout
his	career	with	one	major	exception.	In	2013,	after	several	months	of	net	losses
when	his	trading	approach	seemed	to	be	out	of	sync	with	the	markets,	Brandt	let
himself	 become	 influenced	 by	 general	 talk	 among	 technical	 traders	 that	 the
markets	had	changed.	In	a	moment	of	weakness,	Brandt	abandoned	the	approach
that	had	served	him	so	well	for	so	many	years	and	started	experimenting	with
trading	 methods	 that	 were	 not	 his	 own.	 All	 of	 these	 dalliances	 with	 different
approaches	merely	extended	and	increased	his	losses.	As	a	result,	Brandt	ended
up	with	his	only	losing	year	since	he	resumed	trading	in	late	2006	and,	by	his


own	 admission,	 turned	 what	 should	 have	 been	 a	 5%	 drawdown	 into	 a	 17%
drawdown.

A	corollary	of	trading	your	own	methodology	is	the	principle:	Don’t	trade	based
on	 someone	 else’s	 recommendations.	 In	 Brandt’s	 first	 trade,	 he	 followed	 the
trade	recommendation	of	the	floor	broker	who	had	influenced	him	to	pursue	a
trading	career.	Even	though	the	trade	proved	profitable	for	the	broker,	Brandt
ended	up	losing	money	because	he	didn’t	realize	the	broker’s	time	frame	for	a
trade	was	much	shorter	than	his	own.	It	is	uncanny	how	often	following	other
people’s	advice	or	recommendations	will	turn	out	badly.	You	can	learn	sound
principles	from	other	successful	traders,	but	putting	on	trades	based	on	someone
else’s	recommendation	instead	of	your	own	methodology	will	usually	be	a	losing
proposition.	Remember,	the	next	time	you	lose	money	on	a	trading	tip:	I	told	you
so.

When	asked	what	he	wished	he	knew	when	he	started	trading,	Brandt	said,	“I	am
my	own	worst	enemy.”	Brandt	is	not	alone.	Human	emotions	and	impulses	will
often	lead	traders	to	do	the	wrong	thing.	Brandt	explained	that	he	is	an	impulsive
person	and	that	if	he	simply	watched	the	screen	and	followed	his	instincts	to
enter	trades,	he	would	self-destruct.	Brandt	believes	that	his	success	is	possible
only	because	he	employs	a	precise	process	in	placing	trades,	one	that	excludes
his	emotional	responses.	In	Brandt’s	words,	“Have	a	process:	Make	a	decision,
write	the	order,	place	the	order,	live	with	it.”	Brandt	avoids	watching	the	screen
and	 largely	 restricts	 his	 new	 trading	 positions	 to	 those	 identified	 by	 his
exhaustive	chart	analysis	and	trade	planning	conducted	each	week	between	the
Friday	close	and	Sunday	evening	opening,	a	period	when	the	markets	are	closed.

Brandt’s	 comments	 on	 the	 adverse	 impact	 of	 human	 emotions	 on	 trading
reminded	me	of	William	Eckhardt’s	observation	in	 _The	New	Market	Wizards_ :	“If
you’re	playing	for	emotional	satisfaction,	you’re	bound	to	lose,	because	what

feels	good	is	often	the	wrong	thing	to	do.”^8 	Indeed,	the	best	trades	may	be	the
most	counterintuitive	or	most	difficult	to	take.	One	of	Brandt’s	best	trades	in
2019	was	a	short	grain	position,	which	was	opposite	to	the	direction	he	wanted
to	trade	the	grain	markets.

Having	 a	 specific	 process	 is	 essential	 not	 only	 to	 avoid	 emotional	 trading
decisions,	which	are	usually	detrimental,	but	also	as	a	prerequisite	for	trading
success.	 Every	 successful	 trader	 I	 have	 ever	 interviewed	 had	 a	 specific
methodology;	good	trading	is	the	antithesis	of	a	shoot-from-the-hip	approach.
Brandt	selects	trades	that	meet	specific	criteria,	and	the	timing	of	those	trades	is


well-defined	 down	 to	 the	 entry	 day.	 Once	 he	 is	 in	 a	 trade,	 Brandt	 has	 a
predetermined	point	at	which	he	will	exit	the	trade	if	it	is	losing	money	and	a
plan	for	taking	profits	if	the	trade	is	successful.

Many,	if	not	most,	traders,	particularly	novice	traders,	fail	to	comprehend	the
critical	distinction	between	bad	trades	and	losing	trades—the	two	are	definitely
not	the	same.	Brandt	says	that	if	he	can	look	at	a	chart	a	year	after	a	trade	and	be
able	to	see	the	day	and	price	at	which	he	took	a	position,	then	it	was	a	good
trade,	regardless	of	whether	it	won	or	lost.	In	effect,	Brandt	is	saying	that	the
determinant	 of	 a	 good	 trade	 is	 whether	 you	 followed	 your	 methodology,	 not
whether	 the	 trade	 made	 money.	 (Of	 course,	 the	 implicit	 assumption	 in	 this
perspective	is	that	you	are	using	a	methodology	that	is	profitable	with	acceptable
risk	 over	 the	 long	 run.)	 The	 reality	 is	 that	 some	 percentage	 of	 trades	 in	 any
methodology	will	lose	money,	no	matter	how	good	the	approach	is,	and	there	is
no	way	to	know	a	priori	which	will	be	the	winning	trades.

Many	traders	will	have	a	comfort	level	regarding	trading	size.	They	may	do	well
trading	 smaller	 position	 sizes	 but	 then	 see	 a	 significant	 deterioration	 in	 their
performance	at	larger	position	sizes,	 _even	if	the	markets	they	are	trading	are	still
very	liquid	at	the	larger	position	size	levels_ .	Brandt	had	this	experience	when
Commodities	Corporation	raised	his	allocation	to	the	point	that	he	was	trading
100-lot	 orders	 in	 T-bonds	 instead	 of	 his	 prior	 maximum	 order	 size	 of	 20
contracts.	 Even	 though	 his	 percent	 risk	 per	 trade	 was	 unchanged,	 he	 found
himself	thinking	about	losses	in	dollar	terms	rather	than	percent	of	equity	terms.
Now,	it	may	not	make	sense	that	trading	size	should	make	any	difference	if	the
percent	 risk	 per	 trade	 is	 unchanged	 and	 the	 market	 is	 still	 fully	 liquid	 at	 the
larger	order	size,	but	human	emotions	and	their	impact	on	trading	are	not	subject
to	logic.	The	lesson	here	is	that	traders	should	caution	against	any	abrupt,	large
increases	in	their	trading	level.	Instead,	increases	in	account	equity	should	be
gradual	to	make	sure	that	the	trader	is	comfortable	with	the	increased	trading
size.

Success	in	trading	one’s	own	account	will	not	necessarily	translate	to	success	in
managing	money.	Some	traders	may	be	comfortable	and	do	well	trading	their
own	money	but	may	see	their	performance	fall	apart	when	trading	other	people’s
money.	This	phenomenon	can	occur	because,	for	some	traders,	a	sense	of	guilt	in
losing	other	people’s	money	may	impair	their	normal	trading	decision	process.	It
is	not	a	coincidence	that	the	period	when	Brandt	managed	other	people’s	money
coincided	with	his	worst	drawdown	since	he	returned	to	a	trading	career	in	late

2006.	Interestingly,	the	month	Brandt	returned	all	investor	money	was	the	low


point	of	his	drawdown	and	was	followed	by	20	consecutive	winning	months.
Traders	who	make	the	transition	from	trading	their	own	account	to	managing
money	 should	 be	 closely	 attuned	 to	 whether	 managing	 other	 people’s	 assets
impacts	their	mental	comfort	level	in	making	trading	decisions.

Brandt	 improved	 his	 performance	 by	 eliminating	 what	 he	 calls	 “popcorn
trades”—trades	that	have	a	significant	profit	but	are	then	held	until	the	entire
profit	is	surrendered	or,	even	worse,	until	the	profit	turns	into	a	net	loss.	The
negative	 experience	 of	 these	 trades	 early	 in	 his	 career	 prompted	 Brandt	 to
institute	rules	to	avoid	such	outcomes:

```
1 .	Once	he	has	a	net	profit	on	a	trade	equal	to	1%	of	his	total	equity,	Brandt
will	take	partial	profits.
2 .	Once	a	trade	gets	within	30%	of	his	profit	target,	Brandt	will	employ	much
closer	stop	protection.
```
Another	of	Brandt’s	trading	rules	is:	If	an	open	trade	shows	a	net	loss	as	of	a
Friday	close,	get	out.	Part	of	the	reasoning	here	is	that	carrying	a	position	over
the	 weekend	 embeds	 more	 risk	 than	 holding	 the	 position	 overnight	 on	 a
weekday.	And	since	the	assumption	is	that	the	position	is	at	a	net	loss	as	of	the
Friday	close,	for	a	trader	with	a	low	risk	threshold,	such	as	Brandt,	liquidating
the	position	in	this	scenario	is	prudent	risk	management.	However,	the	primary
reason	for	the	Friday	close	liquidation	advice	is	that	Brandt	views	the	Friday
close	as	particularly	meaningful,	a	perspective	that	implies	that	a	strong	or	weak
close	on	Friday	is	more	likely	than	not	to	see	follow-through	price	action	at	the
beginning	of	the	following	week.	Insofar	as	this	premise	is	true,	even	if	the	trade
ultimately	proves	correct,	there	is	a	good	chance	there	will	be	an	opportunity	to
re-enter	the	trade	at	a	better	price	in	the	following	week.

One	dilemma	faced	by	all	traders	is:	What	should	you	do	when	your	trading
approach	is	out	of	sync	with	the	market?	Brandt	would	advise	that	the	one	thing
you	should	not	do	is	switch	from	a	methodology	that	has	worked	well	to	some
other	 approach.	 Now,	 there	 may	 be	 times	 when	 such	 a	 radical	 change	 is
warranted,	but	only	after	substantial	research	and	analysis	confirm	such	action.
A	 style	 transformation	 should	 never	 be	 undertaken	 lightly	 simply	 because	 a
trader	is	experiencing	an	adverse	streak	in	the	market.	So	what	is	the	appropriate
action	 in	 those	 times	 when	 everything	 a	 trader	 does	 seems	 wrong?	 Brandt’s
response	would	be:	Cut	your	trading	size,	substantially	if	necessary,	until	you	are


once	again	in	sync	with	the	markets.

It	is	noteworthy	that	Brandt’s	first	losing	year	after	becoming	a	full-time	trader
occurred	 immediately	 following	 his	 best	 trading	 year	 ever.	 I	 am	 reminded	 of
Marty	Schwartz’s	comment	in	 _Market	Wizards_ :	“My	biggest	losses	have	always

followed	my	biggest	profits.”^9 	The	worst	drawdowns	often	follow	periods	when
everything	seems	to	be	working	perfectly.	Why	is	there	a	tendency	for	the	worst
losses	to	follow	the	best	performance?	One	possible	explanation	is	that	winning
streaks	lead	to	complacency,	and	complacency	leads	to	sloppy	trading.	In	the
strongly	winning	periods,	the	trader	is	least	likely	to	consider	what	might	go
wrong,	especially	worst-case	scenarios.	An	additional	explanation	is	that	periods
of	excellent	performance	are	also	likely	to	be	times	of	high	exposure.	The	moral
is:	If	your	portfolio	is	sailing	to	new	highs	almost	daily	and	virtually	all	your
trades	are	working,	watch	out!	These	are	the	times	to	guard	against	complacency
and	to	be	extra	vigilant.

Regardless	 of	 your	 trading	 methodology,	 how	 do	 you	 know	 which	 types	 of
trades	 work	 and	 don’t	 work	 over	 the	 long	 run,	 and	 which	 circumstances	 are
favorable	or	unfavorable?	Systematic	traders	can	answer	these	types	of	questions
by	testing	each	classification	of	trades.	Discretionary	traders,	however,	cannot
test	 different	 alternatives	 because,	 by	 definition,	 discretionary	 traders	 can’t
algorithmically	define	what	their	past	trades	would	have	been.	For	discretionary
traders,	the	only	way	to	determine	what	types	of	trades	work	best	and	worst	is	to
classify	and	record	their	trade	results	in	real	time.	Over	time,	this	manual	process
would	 yield	 the	 requisite	 data	 and	 the	 resulting	 trading	 insights.	 One	 thing
Brandt	regrets	is	that	he	failed	to	keep	such	a	log.	For	example,	he	believes	that
trades	that	were	not	on	his	monitor	list	after	his	weekend	analysis	(that	is,	trades
that	 were	 formulated	 as	 a	 response	 to	 _intraweek_ price	 action)	 are	 subpar
performers	 and	 could	 even	 be	 net	 losers.	 He	 believes	 this	 hypothesis,	 but	 he
really	doesn’t	know	if	it	is	true.	He	wishes	he	had	kept	category-delineated	track
records	so	he	could	answer	such	questions.	The	lesson	here	is	that	discretionary
traders	 should	 categorize	 their	 trades	 and	 monitor	 trade	 outcomes	 for	 each
category,	so	they	will	have	the	hard	data	to	know	what	does	and	doesn’t	work.

Patience	 is	 a	 common	 trait	 among	 successful	 traders	 but	 not	 necessarily	 an
innate	one.	In	Brandt’s	case,	his	natural	instincts	lean	closer	to	impatience	than
patience,	but	he	has	the	self-discipline	to	enforce	patience.	For	Brandt,	patience
is	an	essential	component	of	trade	entry—“waiting	for	the	right	pitch,”	as	he
expresses	 it.	 He	 avoids	 the	 temptation	 of	 taking	 every	 trade	 idea	 and	 instead


waits	for	the	compelling	trade—one	where	the	upside	potential	appears	three	to
four	times	greater	than	the	required	risk	with	near-equal	perceived	probability.	In
my	interview	with	Joel	Greenblatt,	the	founder	of	Gotham	Capital,	he	made	a
similar	 point.	 Referencing	 Warren	 Buffett’s	 comment,	 “There	 are	 no	 called
strikes	on	Wall	Street,”	Greenblatt	said,	“You	can	watch	as	many	pitches	as	you

want	and	only	swing	when	everything	sets	up	your	way.”^10

Brandt’s	largest	loss	by	an	enormous	margin	was	his	long	crude	oil	position	at
the	start	of	the	First	Gulf	War.	Crude	oil	prices	dropped	by	about	25%	overnight.
Brandt	 just	 liquidated	 his	 position	 on	 the	 opening	 at	 prices	 far	 below	 his
intended	stop.	He	did	not	consider	waiting	for	a	possible	rebound	to	provide	a
better	exit	point.	Speculating	with	the	loss	in	this	way	would	just	have	made	the
loss	even	worse,	as	crude	oil	prices	continued	to	sink	lower	in	the	following
weeks.	Although	a	sample	size	of	one	doesn’t	prove	anything,	the	implied	lesson
of	“don’t	speculate	with	a	trading	loss,”	is	sound	advice.	A	similar	rule	would
apply	to	trading	errors.	In	both	cases,	traders	should	just	liquidate	the	position
rather	than	gamble	with	the	loss.

Trading	 for	 a	 living,	 as	 Brandt	 does,	 may	 seem	 like	 an	 appealing	 lifestyle
prospect	to	many,	but	it	is	a	far	more	difficult	goal	to	achieve	than	most	people
realize.	Most	aspiring	traders	are	undercapitalized	and	underestimate	the	time	it
takes	 to	 develop	 a	 profitable	 methodology	 (three	 to	 five	 years	 by	 Brandt’s
estimate).	 Brandt	 advises	 against	 trading	 if	 losing	 your	 trading	 stake	 will
meaningfully	 alter	 your	 lifestyle.	 It	 is	 also	 virtually	 impossible	 to	 succeed	 at
trading	if	you	are	dependent	on	trading	profits	to	pay	your	living	expenses.	As
Brandt	notes,	“the	markets	are	not	an	annuity”—you	can’t	reasonably	expect	a
steady	income	flow	from	trading.

Brandt’s	motto	is:	Strong	opinions,	weakly	held.	Have	a	strong	reason	for	taking
a	 trade,	 but	 once	 you	 are	 in	 a	 trade,	 be	 quick	 to	 exit	 if	 it	 doesn’t	 behave	 as
expected.	There	is	nothing	wrong	with	being	dead	wrong	on	a	market	if	you	exit
the	trade	 with	only	 a	 small	loss.	 And	don’t	 be	 concerned	that	 changing	 your
opinion	 will	 make	 you	 look	 foolish.	 Completely	 reversing	 your	 opinion	 on	 a
market	reflects	flexibility,	which	is	an	attribute	for	a	trader,	not	a	weakness.

One	of	the	essential	characteristics	of	successful	traders	is	that	they	love	to	trade.
This	perspective	was	true	of	Brandt	in	his	first	decade-plus	of	trading.	You	can
hear	it	in	his	description	of	his	early	days	when	he	had	a	virtual	compulsion	to
trade.	But	by	the	early-to-mid	1990s,	the	fun	had	gone	out	of	trading	for	Brandt.
Trading,	in	his	words,	had	become	a	“drudgery.”	This	radical	shift	over	time


from	loving	trading	to	dreading	it	meant	that	Brandt	has	lost	perhaps	the	most
essential	 ingredient	 for	 trading	 success,	 and	 the	 wheels	 came	 off	 his
performance.	Over	a	decade	later,	Brandt’s	desire	to	trade	re-emerged,	and	he
once	again	was	very	successful.

The	moral	is:	Be	sure	you	really	want	to	trade.	And	don’t	confuse	wanting	to	be
rich	with	wanting	to	trade.	Unless	you	love	the	endeavor,	you	are	unlikely	to
succeed.

# JASON	Shapiro	achieved	consistent	success	as	a	trader	by	learning	to	do	virtually

the	 exact	 opposite	 of	 what	 he	 did	 instinctively	 in	 his	 first	 decade	 of	 trading.
Shapiro’s	trading	career	spans	over	30	years,	running	the	gamut	from	trading	his
own	 account,	 trading	 portfolios	 for	 various	 asset	 management	 firms,	 and
managing	investor	accounts	through	several	iterations	of	his	own	CTA.	Shapiro
has	managed	assets	from	as	little	as	several	million	dollars	to	as	much	as	$600
million.	At	this	stage	of	his	life,	he	is	quite	content	running	his	current	CTA	as	a
one-man	shop	and	is	not	planning	to	expand	beyond	that	simple	operation.

Shapiro’s	track	record	dates	back	to	2001	and	encompasses	money	managed	at
several	 different	 firms.	 His	 returns	 during	 any	 period	 were	 dependent	 on	 the
target	 volatility	 level	 defined	 by	 the	 allocator,	 which	 varied.	 To	 allow	 for	 a
consistent	track	record,	I	adjusted	his	returns	to	a	single	target	volatility	level	for
the	 entire	 period.	 At	 a	 20%	 target	 volatility,	 his	 average	 annual	 compounded
return	is	34.0%,	and	his	maximum	drawdown	is	less	than	half	of	his	average
annual	 return	 at	 16.1%.	 Because	 Shapiro’s	 volatility	 is	 inflated	 by	 numerous
large	 monthly	 gains,	 his	 volatility	 level	 overstates	 the	 implied	 risk,	 as
demonstrated	by	the	relatively	constrained	maximum	drawdown,	even	at	a	20%
volatility	 level.	 Shapiro’s	 return/risk	 numbers	 are	 extremely	 strong,	 with	 an
_adjusted_ Sortino	 ratio	 of	 2.83	 and	 a	 monthly	 Gain	 to	 Pain	 ratio	 of	 2.45	 (see
Appendix	 2	 for	 the	 definitions	 and	 explanations	 of	 these	 metrics).	 Since	 he
resumed	 trading	 in	 2016	 after	 a	 hiatus	 (discussed	 in	 the	 interview),	 all	 his
performance	 statistics	 have	 surpassed	 the	 corresponding	 full-track-record
numbers.	One	unusual	characteristic	of	Shapiro’s	track	record	is	that	his	returns
are	negatively	correlated	to	stock,	hedge	fund,	and	CTA	indexes.

I	found	Shapiro	through	an	email	I	received,	which	read:	“You	absolutely	must
talk	 to	 Jason	 Shapiro.	 His	 track	 record	 is	 awesome,	 and	 his	 approach	 to	 the
market	 very	 unique	 and	 thought-provoking.”	 The	 message	 was	 sufficiently
intriguing	for	me	to	follow	up.	I	sent	Shapiro	the	following	email:	“I	am	working
on	 a	 new	 _Market	Wizards_ book,	 and	 Bill	 Dodge	 suggested	 you	 would	 be	 a
perfect	 candidate	 for	 inclusion.	 Let	 me	 know	 if	 you	 are	 interested	 in


participating.”

Shapiro	 replied:	 “I’m	 hesitant	 to	 be	 in	 print,	 but	 I	 have	 to	 say	 the	 first	 two
_Market	Wizards_ 	books	set	me	on	my	life	path,	so	I	would	be	happy	to	speak	and
see	where	it	goes	if	that	sounds	good	to	you.”

I	replied	to	Shapiro,	requesting	his	return	data	to	make	sure	he	was	a	good	fit	for
the	book	before	committing	to	a	trip	to	do	an	interview.	I	mentioned	that	I	lived
in	Boulder	and	that	I	might	have	a	trip	to	New	York,	which	I	could	combine	with
a	 side	 trip	 to	 his	 home	 in	 Rhode	 Island.	 Shapiro	 replied,	 mentioning	 that	 he
would	be	attending	a	wedding	in	Boulder	the	following	week,	suggesting	we
might	get	together	for	lunch.	I	replied,	“That’s	super	convenient!”

In	our	subsequent	correspondence	to	arrange	a	meeting,	I	received	the	following
email	from	Shapiro:	“In	the	interest	of	not	wanting	to	waste	your	time,	I	want
you	to	know	after	thinking	a	lot	about	this	over	the	weekend	I’ve	decided	I	really
don’t	want	to	be	in	a	book	at	this	point	in	my	life.	I	have	a	lot	of	respect	for	the
work	you	have	done,	and	it	has	had	a	major	positive	influence	in	my	life,	so	I
would	still	love	to	meet	with	you	and	talk	markets	and	life,	etc.,	but	it	has	to	be
with	the	understanding	of	the	above.”

I	was	disappointed,	but	at	least	there	was	no	travel	involved.	I	agreed	to	meet
Shapiro	at	my	home	office.	I	was	tempted	to	ask	Shapiro	whether	it	would	be
OK	to	turn	the	tape	recorder	on	while	we	talked,	just	in	case	he	had	a	change	of
heart.	But,	he	had	been	definitive	about	not	wanting	to	appear	in	a	book—even
mine—so	I	didn’t	ask.	In	the	next	two	hours,	Shapiro	told	me	his	story.	Not	only
was	 it	 a	 compelling	 narrative,	 but	 Shapiro	 also	 had	 a	 unique	 perspective	 on
trading	and	offered	eminently	quotable	insights	and	advice.

After	our	meeting,	I	regretted	not	having	taken	a	shot	at	asking	for	permission	to
record	our	conversation.	I	sent	Shapiro	the	following	email:	“Glad	we	connected
while	you	were	in	Boulder.	I	have	plenty	of	interview	material	to	keep	me	busy
until	 spring.	 Hopefully,	 with	 time	 to	 mull	 it	 over,	 you	 will	 reconsider
participating	with	a	guarantee	of	your	right	to	review	and	approve	the	chapter	I
write.	I	think	you’ve	got	a	great	story,	and	I’d	love	to	save	it	for	posterity.	I’ll
check	back	in	the	spring	to	see	where	you	are	in	terms	of	possible	participation.”

Four	months	later,	I	sent	Shapiro	the	following	email:	“I	hope	all	is	well	in	this
crazy	time.	As	I	mentioned	to	you	before,	I	think	your	story	would	be	a	great
addition	 to	 the	 _Market	 Wizards_ book	 I	 am	 working	 on—lots	 of	 interesting
material	and	good	lessons.	As	I	also	indicated,	I	always	let	interview	subjects
review	 the	 final	 chapter	 copy	 and	 provide	 corrections	 and	 suggest	 (mutually


agreeable)	revisions	before	anything	gets	published.	The	bottom	line	is	that	you
would	have	to	approve	the	final	product	before	I	used	it.	So	there	is	no	risk	in
participating.	Before,	interviewing	you	would	have	required	my	scheduling	a	trip
to	Rhode	Island.	The	virus	has	made	things	easy	for	me.	The	few	remaining
interviews	I	will	do	for	the	book	will	be	conducted	via	Zoom.	So	would	you	be
willing	to	give	it	a	go?”

Shapiro	 replied	 that	 he	 would	 be	 willing	 to	 do	 the	 interview	 as	 long	 as	 he
reserved	the	right	to	withhold	approval	for	its	inclusion	in	the	book.	Concerned
about	doing	a	ton	of	work	for	nothing,	I	replied,	“Yes,	that’s	the	deal.	But	you
should	know	that	98%	of	the	work	is	turning	the	interview	into	a	chapter	(2%	is
the	 interview).	 If	 you	 felt	 there	 was	 a	 significant	 chance	 you	 might	 decide
against	approval	regardless	of	whether	or	not	you	like	the	chapter	I	write,	you
should	let	me	know.	If,	however,	it’s	simply	a	matter	of	your	not	approving	if
you	don’t	like	the	finished	product,	I	am	not	concerned	about	that.”

An	hour	later,	Shapiro	replied,	“I’m	pretty	sure	I	would	not	like	to	be	in	the	end
product,	Jack.	It’s	just	a	strange	personality	thing.	So	I	don’t	want	you	to	waste
your	 time,	 honestly.”	 One	 minute	 later,	 I	 received	 the	 following	 email:	 “Ah,
screw	it,	let’s	do	it.”

**Did	you	have	any	particular	career	aspirations	as	a	teenager?**

No,	I	was	a	terror	show	as	a	teenager.	I	didn’t	go	to	school,	and	when	I	did	go,	I
didn’t	pay	attention.	I	got	kicked	out	of	three	high	schools.

**Why	did	you	get	kicked	out?**

I	didn’t	do	any	work	because	I	wasn’t	interested	in	anything.	And	when	I	got
into	trouble,	I	didn’t	listen	to	anybody.

**Was	 there	 any	 particular	 reason	 you	 had	 that	 chip-on-the-shoulder
attitude?**

I	don’t	know.	I	thought	kids	were	supposed	to	hate	school,	so	I	did.	I	thought
kids	were	supposed	to	rebel	against	teachers,	so	I	did.

**How	did	your	parents	react	to	your	getting	kicked	out	of	school	multiple
times?**

My	father	pretty	much	backed	out	of	it	by	the	time	I	was	15	or	16	because	he
couldn’t	deal	with	it.	My	mother	was	a	child	psychologist,	oddly	enough,	and
her	attitude	was—and	I	thank	her	to	this	day	for	it—let	him	be,	and	eventually,


he’ll	grow	up	and	find	himself.

**Given	that	you	had	no	interest	in	school	and	presumably	had	poor	grades,
did	you	even	bother	applying	to	any	colleges?**

I	grew	up	in	an	upper-middle-class	suburb.	I	don’t	think	I	even	knew	anybody
who	didn’t	go	to	college.	My	GPA	when	I	graduated	high	school	was	1.7.

**What	kind	of	college	were	you	able	to	get	into	with	those	grades?**

I	 went	 to	 the	 University	 of	 South	 Florida.	 USF	 is	 no	 Harvard.	 They	 had	 an
admission	policy	that	if	your	SAT	and	two	achievement	tests	added	up	to	some
score,	you	automatically	got	in,	regardless	of	your	high	school	grades.	I	was
always	a	good	tester.	I	did	well	enough	to	get	in.	When	they	received	my	final
high	school	grades,	they	placed	me	on	academic	probation.

**What	did	you	major	in?**

Finance.

**Did	you	change	your	attitude	in	college	versus	what	it	was	in	high	school?**

Not	in	the	first	year.	Sometime	in	my	sophomore	year,	a	friend	and	I	got	arrested
for	drunken	stupidity.	We	spent	the	night	in	a	holding	pen	in	downtown	Tampa.	I
came	out	of	that	experience	and	thought,	“This	is	not	what	I	want	to	be	doing
with	my	life.”	From	that	point	on,	I	got	straight	A’s.

**What	happened	after	you	graduated?**

In	college,	I	took	a	liking	to	economics.	It	just	made	sense	to	me.	In	my	last	two
years	of	college,	I	was	reading	a	new	economics	or	business	book	virtually	every
few	days.	In	my	senior	year,	I	was	also	working	almost	a	full-time	job	in	real
estate.	I	was	getting	really	serious,	and	I	thought	I	could	get	into	one	of	the	top
MBA	schools.	I	took	the	GMAT	and	received	almost	a	perfect	score;	I	got	only
one	question	wrong.	I	thought	I	might	be	able	to	get	into	Harvard,	Chicago,	or
Wharton.	But,	of	course,	none	of	them	let	me	in.	They	all	wanted	several	years
of	work	experience.

I	knew	I	wasn’t	going	to	be	getting	a	job	at	Goldman	Sachs	with	a	degree	from
USF,	and	I	wasn’t	quite	sure	what	to	do.	I	graduated	in	1988	when	Japan	was
booming.	I	had	taken	Japanese	in	college,	and	someone	told	me	about	Japan
needing	English	teachers.	I	went	to	Japan	with	my	girlfriend	and	taught	English
there	for	about	a	year.	While	I	was	in	Japan,	I	applied	for	a	job	at	HSBC.	I	went
to	Hong	Kong	to	interview	for	their	executive	development	program,	and	I	got
the	 job.	 It	 was	 a	 five-year	 program	 where	 they	 rotated	 you	 to	 different
departments.


I	told	HSBC	that	I	wanted	to	be	in	the	Treasury	Department	because	I	had	found
out	that	was	where	all	the	trading	was	done.	That,	however,	was	not	what	this
program	 was	 about.	 The	 program	 was	 intended	 to	 develop	 generalist	 bankers
who	could	become	senior	managers	within	the	firm.	I	lasted	about	a	year	before
they	fired	me.	They	hated	me	from	the	beginning.	I	was	a	wiseass,	know-it-all
Jewish	 kid	 from	 New	 Jersey	 working	 in	 a	 Scottish-origin	 institution	 that	 had
been	doing	things	the	same	way	for	125	years	and	wasn’t	looking	to	change.	It
really	wasn’t	a	match.

**Why	did	you	get	fired?**

For	 the	 same	 reason	 the	 high	 schools	 had	 kicked	 me	 out:	 complete
insubordination.

**How	did	you	get	involved	in	trading?**

While	I	was	still	at	HSBC	at	the	Hong	Kong	posting,	I	began	trading	Hang	Seng
futures.	I	played	on	an	American	softball	team.	One	of	the	guys	was	a	broker,
and	 he	 introduced	 me	 to	 futures	 trading.	 I	 bought	 one	 Hang	 Seng	 futures
contract,	but	I	didn’t	know	anything.	I	had	been	an	avid	reader	since	college,	so
my	first	thought	was	I	better	go	out	and	buy	a	book,	to	get	some	idea	of	what	I
am	doing.	I	still	remember	going	out	at	lunch	to	the	bookstore	across	the	street
from	our	office	and	looking	for	a	trading	book.	I	found	this	one	book	with	a
wizard	 on	 the	 cover	 that	 was	 about	 interviews	 with	 traders.	 I	 thought	 that
sounded	good.

**So	the	first	book	you	read	on	trading	was	mine?**

I	had	read	lots	of	books	on	finance	and	economics,	but	this	was	the	first	trading
book	I	read.	I	bought	the	book	at	lunch,	started	reading	at	the	office,	and	finished
it	before	I	went	to	sleep.	I	woke	up	the	next	morning	and	thought,	“I	know	what
I	want	to	do	with	my	life	now.	This	makes	perfect	sense	to	me.”

**What	made	perfect	sense?**

These	 guys	 work	 on	 their	 own	 time.	 They	 were	 super	 contrarians.	 It	 didn’t
matter	what	other	people	thought.	Politics	didn’t	matter.	I	said	to	myself,	“That
is	what	I	want	to	do.”

**Did	any	of	the	traders	interviewed	resonate	particularly	with	you?**

The	 ones	 that	 influenced	 me	 to	 this	 day	 were	 the	 Commodities	 Corporation
traders,	particularly	Jones,	Kovner,	and	Marcus.

**What	happened	to	your	trading	after	you	bought	the	Hang	Seng	index?**

I	think	the	Hang	Seng	index	was	about	4,000	when	I	bought	it,	and	within	six


months,	it	was	at	7,000.	A	great	time	to	be	a	young,	ignorant,	and	stupid	trader	is
when	 there	 is	 a	 runaway	 bull	 market.	 I	 was	 like	 the	 22-year-old	 kid	 buying
NASDAQ	stocks	in	1999—you	couldn’t	lose	as	long	as	you	didn’t	go	short.

**What	did	you	do	after	you	got	fired	from	HSBC?**

I	stayed	in	Hong	Kong	and	worked	for	some	local	brokerage	firms.	I	stayed	up	at
night,	called	US	accounts,	and	tried	to	convince	them	to	trade	through	me.	I	got
some	orders,	but	the	truth	is	I	was	just	trading	all	the	time.

I	sat	next	to	a	smart,	Chinese-Malaysian	woman	named	Jacqui	Chan	who	traded
her	own	account	and	had	previously	traded	for	Morgan	Stanley.	She	funded	my
futures	 account	 with	 $100,000.	 It	 was	 still	 a	 bull	 market,	 and	 once	 I	 was
sufficiently	ahead,	Jackie	took	her	$100,000	back	out.	I	ran	the	account	up	to
$700,000.	 I	 bought	 a	 Porsche,	 and	 I	 was	 planning	 how	 I	 would	 live	 like	 a
billionaire.

Then	the	bull	market	ended.	Within	six	months,	I	blew	out	the	entire	account.
All	I	had	left	was	the	Porsche.	I	switched	jobs,	going	to	another	brokerage	firm.
Eventually,	I	started	trading	my	account	again.	I	made	a	lot	of	money	when	Nick
Leeson	blew	out.

[Nick	Leeson	was	a	trader	for	Barings	Bank	who	was	able	to	successfully	hide	a
string	of	mounting	losses.	By	the	time	his	deception	was	uncovered,	he	had	lost
$1.4	billion,	causing	the	collapse	of	Barings	Bank.]

**How	did	you	make	money	off	of	that	event?**

Leeson	had	a	massive	short	option	position	in	the	Nikkei	stock	index	futures
when	he	was	found	out.	The	Singapore	government	announced	they	were	going
to	liquidate	the	entire	position	that	day.	Nikkei	futures	traded	at	a	15%	to	20%
discount	to	cash	all	day.	I	went	long	futures	and	short	cash.	The	next	day,	cash
and	futures	came	back	in	line.	I	made	almost	20%	on	that	trade	in	one	day.

By	that	time,	I	had	grown	tired	of	living	in	Hong	Kong.	I	attended	a	luncheon
presentation	 on	 the	 London	 Business	 School	 Masters	 in	 Finance	 program.	 It
sounded	interesting	to	me.	I	applied	and	was	accepted.	I	had	about	half	a	year
until	the	program	started.	I	quit	my	job	and	took	the	next	five	months	to	travel
through	 Asia,	 including	 Singapore,	 Malaysia,	 Thailand,	 Burma,	 China,	 and
India.

I	spent	nine	months	in	London,	which	was	the	length	of	the	program.	I	spent
10%	of	my	time	on	schoolwork	and	90%	of	my	time	trading	Hang	Seng	and
S&P	futures.	It	was	during	that	period	of	trading	that	I	learned	a	valuable	lesson.
The	internet	existed,	but	it	was	in	its	early	days.	Remember,	it	could	take	five


minutes	to	load	a	page.	So,	I	had	my	broker	fax	me	charts	every	day.	I	was
trading	in	and	out	and	making	some	money.

At	 one	 point,	 I	 was	 super	 bullish	 on	 the	 Hang	 Seng	 index	 and	 had	 a	 large
position.	 I	 was	 scheduled	 to	 go	 on	 vacation	 to	 Africa	 with	 a	 friend	 of	 mine
during	the	holiday	season	break.	I	was	going	to	be	away	for	about	a	month	with
no	way	to	get	communication	about	the	markets.	I	didn’t	want	to	get	out	of	the
Hang	Seng	position,	but	I	had	no	way	of	following	it.	So,	I	told	my	broker	to	sell
half	my	position	if	the	Hang	Seng	went	down	to	a	specific	price	and	to	sell	the
remaining	half	if	it	got	down	to	a	specified	lower	price.

I	 left	 and	 traveled	 around	 Africa.	 Three	 weeks	 later,	 I	 called	 my	 broker	 and
found	 out	 that	 the	 Hang	 Seng	 was	 15%	 higher.	 I	 made	 over	 $300,000	 while
traveling.	Here	I	was	going	through	all	the	trouble	of	getting	charts	faxed	every
day	and	trading	every	day,	and	then	I	make	far	more	money	because	I	am	away
in	Africa	and	can’t	see	or	do	anything.	That	experience	had	a	significant	effect
on	me.	It	was	like	Jesse	Livermore	used	to	say,	“You	make	your	money	in	the
sitting.”

[Shapiro	was	referring	to	a	quote	in	the	book	 _Reminiscences	of	a	Stock	Operator_
by	Edwin	Lefevre,	whose	unnamed	protagonist	is	widely	assumed	to	be	based
on	Jesse	Livermore.	The	specific	quote	is:	“After	spending	many	years	in	Wall
Street	and	after	making	and	losing	millions	of	dollars,	I	want	to	tell	you	this:	it
never	 was	 my	 thinking	 that	 made	 the	 big	 money	 for	 me.	 It	 was	 always	 my
sitting.	Got	that?	My	sitting	tight!”]

**Was	there	anything	instructive	about	the	London	Business	School	Masters
in	Finance	program	itself?**

The	program	gave	me	a	solid	grounding	in	financial	theory.	It	was	where	I	first
learned	about	the	concepts	and	math	behind	value	at	risk	and	other	risk	metrics.
But	 there	 was	 another	 memorable	 and	 impactful	 experience	 that	 occurred
because	I	was	in	that	program.	A	professor	at	my	business	school	was	married	to
the	head	of	global	fixed	income	for	Salomon	Brothers.	At	my	request,	she	was
generous	enough	to	set	me	up	with	a	meeting	with	him.	He	was	a	very	friendly
and	personable	guy.	He	asked	me	how	I	approached	the	markets.	I	told	him,	“I
try	 to	 find	 out	 what	 everyone	 is	 doing,	 and	 I	 do	 the	 opposite	 because	 when
everyone	is	in	the	same	trade,	they	lose	money.”

He	smiled	at	what	he	perceived	my	naïveté	and	said,	“Well,	there	are	times	when
everyone	can	make	money.	Take	the	European	interest	rate	convergence	trade
right	 now.	 Everyone	 is	 putting	 it	 on,	 and	 as	 long	 as	 the	 euro	 comes	 into


existence,	everyone	will	make	money.”

His	 reasoning	 was	 straightforward:	 If	 the	 euro	 came	 into	 existence,	 which
seemed	a	very	high	probability,	European	interest	rates	had	to	converge.	It	was	a
mathematical	certainty.	The	implied	trade	was	to	buy	the	bonds	of	high-yielding
countries,	such	as	Italy,	and	sell	the	bonds	of	low-yielding	countries,	such	as
Germany.	Because	this	convergence	trade	seemed	like	such	a	sure	thing,	all	the
smart	guys	on	Wall	Street,	including	Long-Term	Capital	Management	(LTCM)
and	Salomon	Brothers,	put	the	trade	on	in	as	much	size	as	they	possibly	could.

Another	trade	that	LTCM	and	other	hedge	funds	had	sizable	positions	in	at	the
time	was	long	Russian	bonds	because	of	their	extremely	high	interest	rates.	In
August	1998	Russia	defaulted	on	its	bonds.	To	help	cover	the	margin	calls	on
this	 trade	 gone	 very	 wrong,	 the	 holders	 of	 these	 positions	 had	 to	 sell	 other
positions	 they	 held,	 which	 were	 primarily	 their	 European	 interest	 rate
convergence	trades.	When	they	all	tried	to	liquidate	this	trade	at	the	same	time,
they	 found	 there	 were	 no	 buyers	 because	 anyone	 who	 wanted	 the	 position
already	had	it	on.	This	trade	ended	up	blowing	up	LTCM	and	Salomon	Brothers.

The	 fascinating	 thing	 about	 this	 whole	 episode	 is	 that	 the	 convergence	 trade
ultimately	worked.	The	euro	did	come	into	existence,	and	European	interest	rates
did	converge.	But	because	the	participation	in	this	trade	was	so	extensive,	most
of	the	people	who	had	the	trade	on	lost	money,	and	in	some	cases,	the	loss	was
significant	enough	to	sink	their	firms.

**What	 happened	 after	 you	 finished	 the	 program	 at	 the	 London	 Business
School?**

I	passed	all	my	classes,	but	I	never	handed	in	the	final	paper	because	I	just	didn’t
want	to	do	the	work.	I	was	sitting	on	over	$500,000,	and	I	thought	I	was	king	of
the	 world.	 I	 was	 27	 years	 old,	 had	 plenty	 of	 money,	 and	 thought	 I	 could	 do
anything	I	wanted.	I	knew	I	didn’t	want	to	look	for	another	job.	I	had	a	girlfriend
in	Thailand,	so	I	moved	there.	I	rented	a	house	in	Phuket	on	the	beach,	brought
in	a	satellite	dish,	and	then	proceeded	to	blow	myself	up.	It	took	about	eight
months	for	me	to	lose	all	the	money	in	my	account.

**How	did	you	lose	the	money?**

The	answer	to	that	question	brings	up	another	important	lesson	I	learned	that	had
a	lasting	effect	on	me.	Now	I	see	people	make	the	same	mistake	all	the	time,	and
I	recognize	in	them	what	I	did	then.	At	the	time,	the	US	stock	market	had	been
going	straight	up,	and	therefore	I	was	going	to	be	bearish,	so	I	could	be	the	hero.
I	kept	shorting	it	and	getting	stopped	out,	over	and	over	again,	all	the	way	up.	I


remember	 the	 market	 selling	 off	 after	 Greenspan	 made	 his	 “irrational
exuberance”	speech	and	thinking,	“Look	at	how	smart	I	am.	Greenspan	and	I	are
the	only	ones	who	get	it.”	That	same	day,	the	S&P	rallied	back	and	finished	the
day	higher.	I	remember	looking	at	my	girlfriend	and	saying,	“I’m	fucking	dead.”

**So,	you	did	recognize	the	importance	of	the	market	initially	selling	off	on
bearish	news	and	then	closing	higher.**

I	 recognized	 it,	 but	 I	 had	 been	 shorting	 all	 along,	 and	 I	 fell	 into	 this
psychological	 trap	 of	 thinking,	 “What,	 _now_ I’m	 going	 to	 go	 long	 after	 being
short	all	this	time	and	losing	all	this	money?”	It	was	a	fear	of	missing	out	on	the
short	move	when	it	finally	happened.	I	don’t	ever	think	like	that	anymore,	but	I
see	other	people	fall	into	the	same	trap	all	the	time.

After	I	lost	all	my	money,	I	still	felt,	“I	can	do	this.”	I	sat	down	and	wrote	out
pages	and	pages	of	what	worked	and	what	didn’t	work.

**What	was	the	essence	of	what	you	wrote	down?**

Don’t	have	an	opinion.	We	used	to	have	a	saying	in	Hong	Kong,	“Should’ve
been	up,	but	it’s	down,	so	short	it;	should’ve	been	down,	but	it’s	up,	so	long	it.”
That	trading	philosophy	became	the	basis	of	what	I	wanted	to	do:	When	the	tape
is	telling	you	something,	don’t	fight	it;	go	with	it.

**What	happened	after	you	blew	out	your	account?**

I	moved	to	Hawaii	to	be	a	partner	in	a	new	CTA.	I	had	gotten	married	to	my
girlfriend	in	the	interim,	and	she	wasn’t	too	thrilled	to	move	to	the	US.

**At	this	point,	you	had	made	money	and	blew	out	the	account,	and	then
made	money	again	and	blew	out	the	account.	What	gave	you	the	confidence
that	you	could	manage	other	people’s	money?**

It	wasn’t	a	matter	of	confidence;	it	was	what	I	was	going	to	do.	There	were	no
two	ways	about	it.	I	was	going	to	figure	it	out.	We	opened	a	futures	account	with
the	other	partner’s	money,	which	I	traded.	I	did	pretty	well,	and	we	used	the
track	record	to	raise	about	a	half-million	dollars.	I	ran	this	account	for	about	18
months	or	so.	Although	I	was	doing	OK,	especially	in	terms	of	return	to	risk,	this
period	coincided	with	the	1998–1999	bull	market	in	NASDAQ	stocks.	I	would
tell	 potential	 investors,	 “We	 made	 12%	 this	 year.”	 They	 were	 clearly
unimpressed	and	would	say,	“Yeah,	so	what,	I	made	12%	this	week.”	I	went	to
some	of	the	CTA	conferences	to	try	to	raise	money,	and	they	looked	at	me	like	I
was	 crazy.	 “What,	 we’re	 going	 to	 give	 you	 money,	 so	 you	 can	 go	 back	 to
Hawaii?	Get	the	hell	out	of	here.”	So,	we	never	really	got	anywhere	with	the
CTA,	 and	 it	 was	 clear	 that	 we	 weren’t	 ever	 going	 to	 get	 anywhere.	 At	 the


beginning	of	2000,	I	moved	to	Chicago	to	take	a	job	as	a	prop	trader	with	the
Gelber	Group.	I	traded	for	them	for	about	a	year.

**Why	did	you	leave	after	a	year?**

I	had	a	job	offer	from	a	hedge	fund	in	New	York.	But	before	we	discuss	that,	I
want	to	go	back	to	the	CTA	because	I	skipped	over	a	pivotal	part	of	the	story.	It
was	while	I	was	running	the	CTA	that	I	discovered	the	COT	(Commitment	of
Traders)	report.	I	was	being	a	contrarian	trying	to	short	the	stock	market	during
the	second	half	of	1999	because	it	had	all	the	typical	signs	you	see	in	a	market
bubble—the	proverbial	shoeshine-boy-giving-you-stock-tips	euphoria.	I	knew	it
was	 a	 short,	 but	 the	 NASDAQ	 went	 up	 another	 50%	 between	 August	 and
January.	 I	 did	 a	 good	 job	 with	 risk	 management	 because,	 even	 though	 I	 was
shorting	 stock	 futures,	 I	 didn’t	 lose	 any	 money	 since	 I	 was	 making	 money
elsewhere,	and	I	was	cutting	my	losses	quickly.	So	when	the	market	was	making
new	highs,	I	wasn’t	staying	short.	I	had	at	least	learned	those	lessons.	Later	on,
when	 I	 was	 at	 Gelber,	 I	 did	 catch	 the	 top	 and	 made	 money	 riding	 it	 down.
Looking	at	the	COT	reports,	I	saw	that	the	data	never	provided	a	sell	signal	until
January	2000.	I	thought,	“That	is	powerful	data.”

[The	 Commitment	 of	 Traders	 is	 a	 weekly	 report	 issued	 by	 the	 Commodity
Futures	 Trading	 Commission	 (CFTC)	 that	 shows	 the	 breakdown	 of	 futures
positions	held	by	speculators	and	commercials	(industry	participants).	The	report
also	provides	more	granular	breakdowns.	For	example,	for	physical	commodity
futures,	 the	 Disaggregated	 COT	 Report	 shows	 four	 categories:
Producer/Merchant/Processor/User,	Swap	Dealers,	Managed	Money,	and	Other
Reportables.

Since,	by	definition,	there	will	always	be	an	equal	number	of	long	and	short
positions	in	each	futures	contract,	the	commercial	and	speculator	positions	will
move	inversely	to	each	other.	The	underlying	premise	of	traders,	such	as	Jason
Shapiro,	who	use	the	report	as	a	market	indicator,	is	that	commercials	will	tend
to	be	right	(because	they	are	better	informed)	and,	by	implication,	speculators
will	 tend	 to	 be	 wrong.	 There	 is	 no	 consensus	 as	 to	 what	 particular	 readings
(levels,	change,	or	duration)	constitute	a	bull	or	bear	signal.	Roughly	speaking,
though,	a	relatively	high	commercial	long	position	(relative	to	historical	levels
and	 seasonal	 tendencies,	 if	 any)	 or,	 equivalently,	 a	 relatively	 large	 speculator
short	position,	would	be	considered	bullish,	and	the	reverse	configuration	would
be	considered	bearish.]

So,	you	might	think	that	people	are	long,	but	are	they	actually	long?	While	the


small	guys	may	have	been	buying	stocks	and	making	money	in	late	1999,	the
large	speculators	knew	it	was	a	bubble	and	were	short.	The	bull	market	didn’t
end	 until	 they	 got	 squeezed	 out.	 Once	 they	 all	 got	 squeezed	 out,	 the	 market
topped	because	there	was	no	one	left	to	buy.	The	COT	report	picked	up	that
information.	That	is	why	I	started	to	look	very	closely	at	the	COT	reports	ever
since	that	time.

**So,	did	your	approach	change	to	not	looking	for	a	market	top	until	the	COT
data	told	you	that	the	environment	was	ripe	for	a	potential	top—namely,
that	the	commercials	were	heavily	short?**

That’s	exactly	right.	I	started	using	the	data	from	that	point	on.

**Aren’t	there	times	when	the	commercials	are	short	for	a	very	long	time,	and
the	market	keeps	going	up,	or	the	commercials	are	long	for	a	very	long	time,
and	the	market	keeps	going	down?**

Sure,	but	I	don’t	just	trade	on	the	COT	numbers.	First	of	all,	I	need	price	action
confirmation,	and	second,	I	have	tight	stops.	For	example,	I	got	long	heating	oil
about	a	month	or	two	ago,	which	meant	the	commercials	were	very	long,	and	the
speculators	were	very	short.	I	got	stopped	out.	I	put	the	position	on	again,	and	I
got	stopped	out	a	second	time.	Then,	all	of	a	sudden,	the	positioning	entirely
changed—the	commercials	were	no	longer	long—which	meant	that	I	could	no
longer	buy	that	market.	That	is	when	the	market	really	started	to	go	down.	So	it
is	true	that	a	couple	of	months	ago,	the	COT	suggested	being	long	the	market.
But	within	a	few	weeks,	it	had	turned	neutral	again,	and	that	is	when	the	price
collapse	really	got	going.

**In	the	COT	reports,	are	you	looking	just	at	position	levels,	or	do	you	also
use	the	weekly	change	in	positions?**

I	just	use	the	position	levels.

**There	are	some	markets,	such	as	gold	and	crude	oil,	where	the	commercials
are	almost	always	short.	I	assume	you	must	be	looking	at	** **_relative_** **	as	opposed
to	** **_absolute_** **	levels.	Is	it	correct	to	say	that	in	these	types	of	markets,	a	buy
area	 for	 the	 COT	 would	 be	 when	 commercials	 are	 short,	 but	 the	 short
position	is	relatively	small	compared	with	the	historical	range?**

That’s	correct.	I	look	at	relative	levels.

**What	happened	with	the	hedge	fund	in	New	York	that	you	joined?**

It	 turned	 out	 that	 it	 wasn’t	 as	 much	 a	 hedge	 fund	 as	 a	 bunch	 of	 thieves	 and
incompetent	traders	in	a	room.	At	that	point,	I	started	using	the	COT	numbers,


not	in	any	systematic	way,	but	just	looking	at	the	report.	It	didn’t	really	matter.
The	other	guys	in	the	firm	were	such	amateurs	that	all	I	had	to	do	was	listen	to
what	they	were	doing	and	do	the	opposite.	In	the	year	I	was	there,	I	made	really
good	returns,	while	they	all	lost	money.	At	the	end	of	the	year,	they	kicked	me
out.

**Why	 would	 they	 kick	 you	 out	 when	 you	 were	 the	 only	 one	 who	 made
money?**

Those	guys	hated	me.	I	was	essentially	fading	them,	making	money,	while	they
were	losing	money.

**Who	fired	you?**

This	guy	named	Leno,	who	managed	the	firm.

**What	reason	did	he	give	you?**

He	told	me	they	weren’t	going	to	be	trading	futures	anymore.

**Why	did	you	say	they	were	a	bunch	of	thieves?**

A	few	years	after	I	left,	the	FBI	busted	Leno	for	insider	trading.

**What	did	you	do	after	you	left	the	hedge	fund?**

I	had	no	job,	and	I	had	a	wife	who	was	telling	me	I	was	a	loser.	My	wife	hated
me,	and	she	wanted	a	divorce.	At	the	time,	I	was	living	in	Princeton.	I	went	to
see	a	lawyer,	and	he	asked	me	what	I	did.	When	I	told	him	I	was	a	trader,	he
asked	me	if	I	had	ever	heard	of	Helmut	Weymar.	I	told	him	that	I	knew	who	he
was	because	I	had	read	 _Market	Wizards_ .	[Helmut	Weymar	was	a	cofounder	of
Commodities	 Corporation,	 the	 firm	 that	 had	 hired	 some	 of	 the	 great	 traders
interviewed	in	 _Market	Wizards_ ,	as	well	as	Peter	Brandt	(see	Chapter	1).]	The
lawyer	told	me	that	his	wife	and	Helmut’s	wife	were	best	friends.	I	told	him	that
if	he	wanted	to	be	my	divorce	lawyer,	he	had	to	get	his	wife	to	introduce	me	to
Helmut.

Two	 days	 later,	 I	 was	 sitting	 in	 front	 of	 Helmut	 in	 his	 large	 office	 with	 the
fireplace.	Although	Helmut	had	just	sold	the	firm	to	Goldman	Sachs,	he	still	had
his	office	in	the	Commodities	Corporation	building.	I	told	Helmut	about	how	I
was	 a	 contrarian	 trader	 and	 used	 the	 COT	 reports	 as	 a	 guide	 for	 market
positioning.	 Helmut	 backed	 me,	 giving	 me	 $2	 million	 to	 manage.	 He	 also
brought	me	in	front	of	the	new	management	of	Commodities	Corporation,	and
they	gave	me	another	$2	million.	I	started	a	small	CTA	with	$4	million.	I	did
well	 for	 them,	 making	 22%	 in	 my	 first	 year	 managing	 the	 account.	 I	 was
expecting	 that	 they	 would	 give	 me	 more	 money	 to	 manage,	 but	 it	 never


happened.	I	think	it	was	a	political	thing	where	the	new	Goldman	Sachs	people
didn’t	want	to	be	told	what	to	do	by	Helmut,	who	was	supposed	to	be	leaving	the
firm.

At	 the	 time,	 I	 got	 a	 job	 offer	 from	 David	 Reed,	 who	 ran	 Cranmore	 Capital
Management	to	trade	an	account	for	them.	Knowing	David	the	way	I	do	now,
but	I	didn’t	know	then,	he	hired	me	for	one	reason:	He	figured	that	if	Helmut
wanted	me,	then	he	wanted	me.	He	offered	me	a	bonus	to	join	the	firm.	So	I
closed	my	CTA	and	moved	up	to	Connecticut	to	work	for	Reed.

**How	much	money	did	he	give	you	to	manage?**

He	gave	me	a	$5	million	account	to	manage	to	start,	which	was	still	more	than	I
was	managing	for	Helmut	and	Commodities	Corporation,	and	I	knew	they	had
the	assets	to	build	the	account	to	much	larger	levels	if	I	did	well.

**So	how	did	that	work	out?**

It	was	a	nightmare.	As	much	as	Reed	told	me	that	he	got	everything	I	was	saying
when	he	recruited	me,	once	I	was	there,	he	didn’t	get	it	at	all.	During	the	six
months	I	was	there,	trend	following	went	through	a	great	period.

**I	was	about	to	ask	you	about	that.	I	know	that	Reed’s	firm—at	least	in	those
days—was	entirely	focused	on	trend-following	strategies.	Your	approach—
contrarian	trading—was	virtually	the	exact	opposite.**

It	 should	 have	 been	 complementary,	 though,	 because	 my	 approach	 would	 be
negatively	correlated	to	their	trend-following	strategies.	After	I	had	been	there
for	a	half	year,	Reed	called	me	into	his	office.	I	was	down	maybe	1%	or	2%	at
the	most,	but	during	the	same	time,	trend	following	had	a	great	run.	He	said,	“I
don’t	understand	how	your	strategies	will	work.	I’m	going	to	make	money	70%
of	the	time.	That	means	that	you’re	going	to	lose	money	70%	of	the	time.”

I	said,	“We	talked	about	this	for	a	month	while	you	were	recruiting	me.	I	told
you	why	that	wasn’t	the	case,	and	you	agreed	it	wasn’t	the	case.”	Variations	of
this	 conversation	 went	 on	 for	 a	 month	 or	 so,	 and	 I	 was	 getting	 increasingly
frustrated.	During	that	time,	the	firm	moved	into	new	offices,	and	Reed	gave	a
speech	to	the	employees	about	how	the	key	to	life	was	that	you	should	never	be
satisfied.	I	thought	that	was	the	most	ridiculous	advice	I	had	ever	heard.	When	I
was	traveling	through	Burma,	I	spent	a	month	in	a	monastery,	and	my	attitude	is
that	you	should	always	be	satisfied.	I	thought	to	myself,	“I’m	getting	the	hell	out
of	here.”	The	next	day	I	walked	into	Reed’s	office,	gave	him	back	my	signup
bonus	money,	and	left.

**Tell	me	about	your	monastery	experience	in	Burma.**


I	went	to	Burma	to	check	it	out.	At	that	time,	it	was	just	opening	to	foreigners.
The	 monastery	 sits	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 Inle	 Lake,	 which	 is	 the	 largest	 lake	 in
Burma.	The	only	way	to	get	there	was	by	longboat,	which	the	boatman	rowed
standing	up	using	his	leg.

I	remember	sitting	on	the	floor	in	the	monastery	eating	from	a	bowl	of	peanuts
they	had	there.	A	monk	came	over,	sat	beside	me,	and	spoke	to	me	in	perfect
English.	After	talking	for	a	while,	he	invited	me	to	stay.	I	ended	up	staying	for	a
month.

I	shaved	my	head	and	sat	in	a	room	meditating	without	talking	to	anyone.	But
the	thing	that	impacted	me	most	was	going	out	with	the	monks	every	morning	to
receive	alms.	The	monks	don’t	work	or	cook.	They	depend	on	the	people	to	give
them	food	to	eat.	We	had	to	go	out	every	morning	with	our	alms	bowl	and	walk
through	these	villages,	and	the	people	would	fill	our	bowls	with	rice	and	fish,
and	that	is	what	we	would	eat	for	the	day.	That	experience	had	a	big	effect	on
me.	 I	 was	 a	 kid	 from	 an	 upper-middle-class	 background	 who	 was	 given
everything	he	needed	and	took	advantage	of	it	to	the	extreme.	And	here	I	was
walking	around	in	Burma,	and	these	people	who	didn’t	have	two	dollars	to	their
name	were	giving	me	food	to	eat	every	day.	It	was	a	very	humbling	experience.

**Did	your	experience	at	the	monastery	change	you?	Do	you	think	you	were	a
different	person	after	the	monastery	experience	than	before	it?**

There	is	no	question	about	it.	When	you	sit	in	a	place	for	a	month	with	nothing
to	do	but	think,	and	the	only	things	you	eat	are	what’s	given	to	you,	it	changes
your	 attitude	 as	 to	 what	 is	 important.	 At	 that	 point	 in	 my	 life,	 what	 seemed
important	was	professional	success	and	getting	a	big	house.	Afterward,	I	never
cared	about	any	of	that.	It	helped	me	calm	down	from	the	idea	that	money	is
everything	and	is	so	important—because	it’s	not.

**So	what	is	important?**

Happiness—spending	your	day	doing	what	you	want	to	do.	If	I’m	good	at	what	I
do,	 I	 make	 money,	 and	 that’s	 great,	 but	 it’s	 not	 the	 driver.	 The	 driver	 is	 the
satisfaction	I	get	from	being	good	at	something.	People	say,	“It’s	easy	for	you	to
say	that	now	because	you	have	money.”	OK,	that’s	true,	but	there	have	been
quite	a	few	times	when	I	was	deadass	broke.	When	I	started	managing	money
for	Helmut,	I	had	two	kids,	and	we	lived	in	a	two-bedroom	apartment—and	my
office	was	in	one	of	the	bedrooms!	I	couldn’t	even	afford	a	desk;	I	used	one	of
those	IKEA	TV	stands.	My	kids	were	little	then.	I	still	remember	going	to	the
store	to	buy	a	camcorder.	It	was	$700,	and	I	couldn’t	afford	to	buy	it.


While	there	was	some	pressure	in	not	having	money,	the	truth	is	that	I	was	as
happy	then	as	I	am	now.	I	couldn’t	believe	it:	Helmut	Weymar,	who	had	hired
some	of	the	greatest	traders	who	have	ever	lived,	was	giving	me	money,	and	I
was	trading	for	a	living.	Happiness	is	believing	that	the	future	will	be	better	than
the	past.

Even	now,	I	just	bought	this	house,	and	it’s	great,	and	I	love	it,	but	it	is	not	a
mansion	on	the	beach.	I	drive	a	1998	Toyota	4Runner.	It	doesn’t	mean	anything
to	me;	it’s	just	a	piece	of	transportation.	I	don’t	need	to	be	driving	around	in	a
Land	Rover.	I	think	it	all	started	with	my	being	in	that	monastery	in	Burma.

**What	did	you	do	after	you	left	Cranmore	Capital?**

I	went	back	to	Helmut,	and	he	gave	me	some	money	to	manage.	I	also	got	some
other	investor	money,	and	I	restarted	my	CTA	with	about	$3	million.	I	did	that
for	almost	two	years,	making	about	10%	to	15%	a	year.	With	only	$3	million
under	management,	it	is	tough	to	raise	any	more	money.	You	need	infrastructure,
and	I	couldn’t	afford	infrastructure.	It’s	the	whole	catch-22	thing.	Also,	I’m	not
exactly	a	marketing	guy.

An	acquaintance	I	had	became	the	CIO	at	Walter	Garrison	and	Associates,	a
large	multistrategy	hedge	fund.	He	offered	me	a	job	as	a	trader	for	the	firm	with
a	$250,000	salary,	a	starting	account	of	$50	million	to	manage,	a	full-time	quant
working	for	me,	and	a	big	office	with	a	window	overlooking	Park	Avenue.	So,	I
closed	my	CTA	again	and	went	to	work	for	Walter	Garrison.

Having	a	full-time	quant	assigned	to	me	allowed	me	to	quantify	a	lot	of	what	I
was	 doing.	 We	 ran	 the	 program	 mostly	 systematized,	 but	 sometimes	 I	 would
override	a	system	trade,	and	sometimes	I	would	take	a	trade	the	system	wasn’t
putting	on.

**Were	those	non-systematic	trades	helpful	or	detrimental?**

They	made	money.	My	trader	would	argue	with	me	all	the	time,	saying,	“Why
are	 we	 doing	 this?”	 And	 I	 would	 tell	 him,	 “Because	 it	 makes	 money.”	 We
tracked	what	happened	when	I	overrode	the	system.	If	it	didn’t	make	money,	I
wouldn’t	have	continued	to	do	it.

**What	types	of	trades	were	you	putting	on	that	weren’t	part	of	the	system?**

They	 were	 mostly	 stock	 index	 trades.	 I	 spoke	 regularly	 to	 this	 guy	 James
Vandell,	a	former	colleague.	James	was	a	perennial	bear.	Whenever	James	would
get	super	bearish,	I	would	go	long,	and	when	he	would	get	bullish,	which	didn’t
happen	very	often,	I	would	go	short.	It’s	hard	to	see	what	a	winner	looks	like,
but	it’s	easy	to	see	what	a	loser	looks	like.	I	thought	to	myself,	“I’ve	been	there.”


The	things	James	was	saying	and	doing	were	exactly	what	I	was	thinking	and
doing	when	I	blew	up	in	Thailand.	I	recognized	it	because	I	had	done	the	same
thing	before.	I’m	not	saying	that	I	was	smarter	than	him;	I’m	saying	that	he	was
doing	exactly	what	I	did,	and	I	knew	how	that	would	end	because	I	went	broke.
So,	this	time,	I	was	going	to	do	the	opposite	of	what	was	essentially	a	proxy	for
me	back	in	Thailand	and	make	money	off	it	instead	of	losing	money.	When	the
COT	wasn’t	providing	a	trade	signal,	and	James	had	a	strong	opinion,	he	was	my
contrarian	indicator.

**So,	instead	of	using	the	COT	numbers	as	the	basis	for	a	trade,	you	were
using	a	human	COT.**

It’s	precisely	the	same	thing.	People	ask	me	all	the	time,	“What	would	you	do	if
they	stopped	publishing	the	COT	numbers?”	I	tell	them	that	I	can	trade	right	off
of	CNBC.	You	can	watch	CNBC	or	Bloomberg	all	day,	and	10	people	will	come
on	and	say	the	exact	same	thing.

**Have	 you	 actually	 done	 that—place	 trades	 based	 on	 fading	 opinions	 on
CNBC?**

I	do	it	all	the	time.	Most	of	the	time,	the	COT	will	line	up	with	the	opinions	on
TV	anyway.	If	everyone	is	saying	you	have	to	buy	gold,	it’s	no	coincidence	that
the	COT	is	showing	everyone	is	long	gold.

I	don’t	just	make	these	trades	on	a	whim,	though.	These	guys	may	all	be	talking
about	something,	but	I	still	need	the	market	to	provide	confirmation.	If	they	are
all	super	bearish,	and	the	Dow	goes	down	one	thousand	points	and	closes	on	the
low,	I’m	not	going	to	be	a	buyer.	But	if	they	are	all	super	bearish,	and	some
really	negative	news	came	out	that	day,	but	the	market	closes	higher,	I’m	buying.
I	learned	my	lesson.	You	don’t	fight	the	tape.	Be	patient,	and	the	market	will	tell
you	when.

The	low	of	the	reversal	day	will	be	my	stop.	I’m	not	going	to	argue	with	it.	If	I
go	 long,	 and	 the	 market	 goes	 back	 to	 the	 low	 of	 that	 day,	 I’m	 out.	 I’m	 so
disciplined	with	this	stuff.	It’s	not	just	that	I	have	a	stop	on	every	trade,	which	I
do,	but	that	I	have	a	stop	that	is	based	on	some	meaningful	market	move.	The
news	came	out,	the	market	gapped	down,	and	then	it	closed	up.	OK,	that	low	is
going	to	be	my	stop	forever.	If	that	low	is	hit,	I’m	out.

**So	the	contrary	opinion	indicators	you	use	only	tell	you	what	direction	you
should	be	looking	for	a	trade	in	a	given	market,	but	to	actually	get	a	trade,
you	have	to	wait	for	a	signal	based	on	the	market	action.	And	if	that	market
action	 subsequently	 gets	 contradicted,	 the	 premise	 for	 your	 trade	 is**


**eliminated,	and	you’re	out.**

Yes,	that’s	100%	correct.	You	need	both	the	market	positioning	and	the	market
action.	 I	 don’t	 know	 which	 is	 more	 important,	 but	 they	 are	 both	 extremely
critical.

**That	explains	how	you	can	be	a	contrarian	in	the	market	without	having
open-ended	risk.**

If	you	pay	attention	to	both	the	positioning	and	market	action,	you	won’t	get	run
over.

**I	understand	that	if	the	market	goes	back	to	the	low	or	high	of	the	day	you
view	as	the	reversal	point,	you	will	stop	out	of	the	position,	but	what	gets
you	out	if	your	stop	is	not	hit?**

I	will	take	profits	when	the	market	positioning	that	got	me	into	the	trade	goes
back	to	neutral.

**What	constitutes	a	neutral	reading?**

I	have	a	sentiment-based	oscillator	I	developed.	When	it	goes	to	zero,	I	look	to
be	a	buyer,	when	it	goes	back	to	50,	I’m	out.

**Is	your	oscillator	based	just	on	the	COT	reports,	or	does	it	include	other
inputs?**

I	prefer	not	to	put	the	answer	to	that	question	in	the	book.

**Earlier,	you	mentioned	using	CNBC	as	a	contrary	indicator.	Is	there	any
particular	program	that	you	pay	the	most	attention	to?**

I	watch	 _Fast	Money_ 	religiously	at	5	p.m.	EST	every	day.	I	can’t	tell	you	how
much	money	I’ve	made	off	of	that	show.	It’s	the	greatest	consensus	show	ever.
They	have	four	people	on	who	give	their	opinions.	All	I	watch	is	the	first	five
minutes	when	they	come	up	with	their	excuses	for	why	they	think	the	market	did
what	it	did	that	day,	and	the	last	two	minutes	in	a	segment	called	 _Final	Trade_
when	they	all	come	up	with	their	trade	idea	for	the	next	day.	There	is	one	guy	on
the	program	named	Brian	Kelly,	who	I	have	now	watched	for	years.	He	is	wrong
by	such	a	larger	percentage	than	random	that	it	is	hard	to	believe.	I	will	never
have	a	position	on	if	he	is	recommending	it.

**Do	you	watch	CNBC	during	the	trading	day?**

I	 have	 it	 on	 in	 the	 background	 all	 day.	 If	 someone	 comes	 on	 talking	 about
something	I’m	interested	in,	I’ll	turn	the	volume	up.	I	already	know	what	they’re
going	to	say	because	they	all	say	the	same	thing.	If	the	market	has	been	going
down,	they	will	make	the	bearish	argument.	Recently,	on	this	rebound	off	the


March	low	[the	March	2020	low,	which	followed	the	huge	selloff	triggered	by
events	related	to	the	COVID-19	pandemic],	you	kept	on	hearing	lines	like:	“The
market	doesn’t	make	any	sense	right	here.”	“The	low	is	not	in.”	“The	market	has
gone	up	too	far,	too	fast.”	In	the	meantime,	the	market	has	continued	to	rally
further.	All	these	people	think	they	are	smarter	than	the	market.	Again,	I’ve	been
there.	They	are	not.	No	one	is.

The	 most	 powerful	 word	 in	 the	 markets	 is	 “despite.”	 If	 you	 hear	 or	 see	 a
comment	like,	“Despite	the	increase	in	oil	inventories	being	much	higher	than
expected,	oil	prices	closed	higher,”	that	is	the	tape	telling	you	what	is	going	to
happen.	Everyone	saw	inventories	were	much	higher	than	expected.	Why	did	the
market	close	up?	The	tape	knows	more	than	anyone	else.

**Were	you	long	on	the	rebound	off	the	March	low?**

Yes,	at	the	lows,	the	COT	data	was	in	a	bullish	zone	for	the	Dow	futures,	and	we
had	an	upside	reversal	on	a	day	when	all	the	news	was	negative.	Funny	enough,
that	previous	evening,	I	was	on	a	chat	group	started	by	a	former	colleague.	One
of	the	guys	on	the	call,	Adam	Wang,	is	one	of	the	greatest	fades	that	I	know.
Adam	is	one	of	those	Ph.D.,	smarter-than-everyone-else	type	of	guys	who	works
as	a	risk	manager.	He	doesn’t	trade	any	money	because	if	he	did,	he	would	blow
out.

It	was	one	of	those	days	when	the	S&P	was	down	sharply	again	to	a	new	low	for
the	move.	Adam	came	on	the	group	chat	and	said,	“I	haven’t	seen	any	panic.
This	market	has	a	lot	further	to	go.	There	hasn’t	been	any	capitulation	yet.”	It
was	the	same	thing	everyone	on	TV	was	saying	that	week.	This	is	a	guy	who
hadn’t	mentioned	anything	about	the	market	going	down	before.	Now	that	the
market	is	down	30%	in	three	weeks,	he’s	saying	it’s	not	the	bottom	because	there
is	no	capitulation.

As	soon	as	Adam	opened	his	mouth,	I	knew	the	market	was	going	to	run.	The
market	went	limit	down	to	new	lows	that	night.	I	put	on	a	partial	long	position
that	night.	I	put	on	the	full	position	the	next	day	as	the	market	rallied	sharply	off
the	lows,	closing	up	for	the	day,	despite	a	preponderance	of	bearish	news.

**Was	it	a	coincidence	that	this	chat	was	on	the	same	day	that	the	market
spiked	to	a	major	relative	low?**

It’s	never	a	coincidence.	That’s	the	point.	Adam	was	a	sample	of	everyone	else.
The	fact	that	the	chat	started	lighting	up	was	itself	a	sign	that	the	market	was	at	a
capitulation	point.	If	all	these	guys	were	talking	about	how	bearish	the	market
was,	then	everyone	was	talking	about	it.


**We	got	off	on	a	tangent	in	your	career	story.	What	happened	with	your
position	at	Garrison?**

I	went	from	$50	million	to	$600	million	under	management	in	two	years.	I	was
there	five	years	and	did	really	well,	making	money	every	year,	including	2008.	I
thought	the	2008	performance	was	my	finest	moment	since	trend	following	did
exceptionally	well	that	year,	and	I	used	a	countertrend	approach.	Everything	was
great.	I	had	a	few	million	in	the	bank,	and	I	lived	in	a	big	house	in	Westport,
Connecticut.

**If	everything	was	going	so	well,	why	did	you	leave	Garrison?**

I	left	because	the	political	structure	in	the	firm	changed	in	a	way	I	thought	would
be	problematic.	At	that	point,	I	was	working	from	home.	I	would	go	into	the
office	only	once	a	month	for	a	portfolio	managers	meeting.	I	didn’t	want	to	be	a
partner	or	a	boss;	all	I	wanted	was	to	be	left	alone	and	manage	money.

As	 I	 was	 trying	 to	 figure	 out	 what	 to	 do,	 the	 former	 marketing	 director	 at
Garrison,	who	had	left	to	join	The	Henton	Group,	contacted	me.	He	wanted	me
to	manage	money	for	them.	I	went	to	Walter	and	asked	him	to	start	a	separate
CTA	that	I	would	manage.	He	didn’t	want	to	set	a	precedent	because	then	the
other	portfolio	managers	would	also	want	their	own	fund.	I	totally	understood
his	point;	you	can’t	run	a	business	on	exceptions.	So	I	left.

**Were	you	managing	close	to	$600	million	when	you	left	Garrison?**

No,	Garrison	lost	a	lot	of	assets	after	2008.	So,	when	I	left,	I	was	managing	only
about	$150	million.

**How	long	were	you	at	Henton	after	you	left	Garrison?**

I	wasn’t	at	Henton;	I	managed	their	account	through	a	CTA	I	set	up.

**How	much	money	were	you	managing?**

I	managed	$150	million	for	Henton,	and	I	raised	another	$60	million	from	other
investors.	I	managed	those	accounts	for	three	years	until	I	shut	down	my	CTA.

**Why	did	you	shut	down	your	CTA?**

It	was	a	life	event.	I	got	divorced—the	divorce	I	never	got	in	Princeton.

**I	guess	the	divorce	was	the	catalyst,	but	were	there	other	reasons	why	you
decided	to	shut	down	the	CTA?**

I	was	not	enjoying	what	I	was	doing	at	all.	I	like	to	trade,	and	I	wasn’t	doing	any
trading.	I	was	running	my	trading	program	totally	systematized	for	marketing
purposes.	 Investors	 would	 ask,	 “Are	 you	 100%	 systematized?”	 I	 could	 just
answer	the	question,	“Yes.”	Initially,	it	had	seemed	like	a	good	idea.	It	was	an


easy	life.	I	didn’t	even	have	to	think.	I	could	hire	a	trader	whose	only	job	was	to
execute	the	orders	the	system	generated.	Although	the	returns	were	still	good,
they	were	degrading	from	what	I	had	done	before.	And	I	couldn’t	go	back	to
doing	a	discretionary	overlay	because	we	had	marketed	the	program	as	being
fully	systematic,	and	investors	had	put	us	in	their	fully	systematic	fund	products.

Also,	 I	 was	 really	 bothered	 by	 the	 return	 degradation.	 My	 CTA	 was	 making
money,	 but	 it	 wasn’t	 doing	 anything	 special.	 My	 annual	 return	 to	 maximum
drawdown	ratio	had	always	been	in	the	3	to	4	area,	now	it	was	in	the	2	area.	I
had	spent	so	many	years	trading,	blew	out	so	many	times,	and	learned	so	many
lessons	that	I	felt	I	should	be	one	of	the	top	traders	in	the	world.	And,	if	I	wasn’t
going	to	be	that,	then	screw	it.

I	had	six	people	working	for	me,	and	I	hated	it.	I	didn’t	like	managing	people
and	being	responsible	for	their	success.	My	staff	looked	to	me	to	go	out	and	help
with	the	marketing,	which	I	didn’t	like	doing.

**Why	did	you	have	so	many	people	working	for	you?**

Because,	when	I	started	the	CTA,	I	was	planning	to	build	an	institutional	asset
management	firm.	I	was	going	to	raise	a	few	billion	dollars.	So,	I	had	to	have	a
trader,	a	marketing	guy,	a	quant,	etc.

**What	was	the	name	of	your	CTA?**

Perbak.

**Perback?**

P-E-R-B-A-K.

**Did	Perbak	stand	for	something?**

The	night	we	had	to	name	the	CTA,	I	was	reading	a	book	called	 _How	Nature
Works_ 	by	a	famous	physicist	named	Per	Bak.	I	liked	the	things	he	had	to	say
about	human	nature,	so	I	named	the	firm	after	him.	We	would	give	out	his	book
to	people	who	came	to	our	office.

**After	you	shut	down	the	CTA,	did	you	stop	trading	altogether—even	for
your	own	account?**

Yes,	I	bought	a	farm	in	Rhode	Island.

**What	was	your	plan?**

I	didn’t	have	one.	I	just	felt	I	had	to	reevaluate	my	life.	I	figured	I	would	live	like
Thoreau	 for	 a	 while.	 It	 took	 me	 six	 months	 to	 throw	 out	 my	 back	 chopping
wood.

**Why	did	you	pick	Rhode	Island?**


It	was	close	enough	to	my	kids	and	far	enough	from	my	ex-wife,	who	lived	in
Connecticut.	 I	 also	 picked	 Rhode	 Island	 because	 of	 a	 business	 opportunity.
Marijuana	had	just	become	legal	in	Rhode	Island,	and	it	looked	to	me	like	an
incredible	opportunity.	There	was	so	much	money	to	be	made,	and	there	was	a
significant	barrier	to	entry.

**What	barrier?**

Most	 people	 didn’t	 want	 to	 have	 the	 stigma	 of	 being	 involved	 in	 the	 pot
business.	I	didn’t	care	about	any	stigma.

**What	was	the	opportunity	that	you	saw?**

A	lot	of	people	wanted	to	grow	pot,	but	they	didn’t	have	any	money	to	start	an
operation.	 We’re	 not	 talking	 about	 doctors,	 lawyers,	 or	 hedge	 fund	 managers
looking	to	grow	pot;	these	are	24-year-old	kids	who	didn’t	go	to	college	and	are
working	 at	 some	 blue-collar	 job.	 They	 didn’t	 have	 the	 $150,000–$200,000
startup	cost	for	setting	up	a	growing	facility	that	could	generate	$400,000	a	year
in	revenue.	I	started	building	these	facilities	and	then	renting	them	out	at	$6,000
a	 month.	 I	 knew	 what	 the	 operators	 were	 making	 and	 that	 they	 could	 easily
afford	that	rent.	It	would	take	me	about	two	years	to	make	back	my	investment.

**I	guess	the	people	who	were	running	these	operations	also	did	quite	well.**

They	were	making	$200,000	or	more	a	year,	and	I	did	a	six-year	lease-to-own
deal	with	them,	so	they	owned	the	business	after	six	years.	It	was	definitely	a
win-win	situation	and	a	good	business	idea.

**How	many	people	did	you	set	up	in	this	business?**

About	40.

**When	did	you	get	back	to	trading?**

About	a	year	and	a	half	after	I	had	shut	down	my	CTA.	Even	though	I	was	very
happily	 remarried	 and	 had	 all	 the	 money	 I	 needed,	 I	 went	 through	 a	 weird
depression.	I	felt	that	something	was	missing	in	my	life.	The	only	thing	I	could
think	of	was	trading.	It	was	what	I	had	done	for	25	years	of	my	life,	and	it	was
what	I	was	best	at.	I	thought	I	could	be	one	of	the	best	traders	in	the	world.	So
why	was	I	not	doing	it?	Through	all	the	ups	and	downs	in	my	life,	I	had	never
gone	through	any	depression.

**Didn’t	you	get	depressed	at	all	those	times	you	lost	all	your	money?**

I	may	have	been	sad	temporarily,	but	I	was	never	depressed	about	it.	My	reaction
always	was,	“OK,	what	do	I	have	to	do	now	to	make	sure	this	doesn’t	happen
again?”


**How	did	you	figure	out	what	was	causing	your	depression?**

It	was	obvious.	I	loved	trading.

**Was	there	a	catalyst	that	got	you	back	into	trading?**

I	visited	an	old	friend	and	neighbor	and	talked	to	him	about	how	I	felt.	He	put
me	in	touch	with	a	contact	he	had	at	Bryson	Securities,	and	they	gave	me	an
account	to	trade.	Bryson’s	attitude	is,	“We	don’t	care	what	you	do;	just	make
money.”	If	you	lose	money,	you’re	gone;	if	you	make	money,	they	love	you.
They	never	questioned	my	trades	or	what	I	did.	Not	trading	for	18	months	clears
your	mind.	I	used	my	system	and	overlaid	my	discretion	and	risk	management
on	 top	 of	 it.	 I	 was	 able	 to	 use	 everything	 that	 I	 knew	 from	 my	 25	 years	 of
experience.	It	was	great.

**Besides	the	times	you	blew	out	early	in	your	trading	career,	are	there	any
trades	that	stand	out	as	being	particularly	painful?**

No.	I	don’t	get	stuck	in	bad	trades;	I	just	get	stopped	out.	I	may	miss	trades
because	I	am	stubborn.	But	I	will	never,	ever	violate	my	stop.	So,	I	don’t	get
myself	in	those	situations	anymore.

**Obviously,	a	critical	component	of	your	risk	management	is	placing	a	stop
on	every	trade	at	a	point	that	negates	your	hypothesis	that	the	market	has
peaked	or	bottomed.	Are	there	other	elements	in	your	risk	management
strategy?**

When	investors	talk	to	me	about	my	risk	management,	they	ask,	“Do	you	use
value	at	risk?”	I	tell	them	that	I	don’t	because	I	think	it	is	garbage.	Value	at	risk
is	based	on	historical	correlations,	whether	it	is	30	days,	60	days,	90	days,	or
longer.	 When	 you	 get	 markets	 like	 we’ve	 seen	 recently	 [the	 interview	 was
conducted	April	2020],	correlations	can	break	down	in	48	hours.	The	value	at
risk	 will	 have	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 the	 current	 risk.	 By	 the	 time	 value	 at	 risk
catches	up	to	reflecting	an	abrupt	shift	in	correlations,	it’s	too	late.

I	am	my	own	risk	management.	I	look	at	the	market	all	day.	I’m	paying	attention
to	the	market	correlations,	especially	the	correlations	of	the	positions	I	am	in.	If	I
see	that	I	am	concentrated	in	positions	that	are	all	moving	together,	I	will	either
reduce	my	position	or	put	on	a	position	that	will	be	inversely	correlated.	That	is
why	 my	 volatility	 hasn’t	 gone	 up	 despite	 the	 explosion	 of	 market	 volatility
during	 the	 past	 couple	 of	 months.	 I	 saw	 what	 was	 happening	 and	 what	 my
positions	were,	and	I	reduced	my	positions.	Did	I	make	money?	Yes,	but	what’s
even	better	is	that	my	volatility	didn’t	go	up	one	iota.	If	you	look	at	my	daily
returns,	you	wouldn’t	have	any	idea	that	what	had	just	happened	in	the	markets


happened.

**Was	 that	 because	 you	 reduced	 your	 positions	 or	 because	 you	 added
uncorrelated	positions?**

It	 was	 mostly	 due	 to	 my	 reducing	 positions.	 However,	 when	 correlations
suddenly	 increase,	 as	 they	 did	 recently,	 I	 will	 be	 more	 inclined	 to	 add	 an
inversely	correlated	position	without	necessarily	having	an	official	signal.	As	an
example,	after	the	February	2020	top,	I	took	a	short	trade	in	the	stock	index,
even	though	it	wasn’t	my	typical	type	of	signal,	because	being	short	the	stock
index,	when	I	was	long	other	markets,	reduced	my	risk.

The	February	top	in	the	stock	market	was	unusual.	Typically,	the	market	goes
up,	up,	up,	and	speculators	get	more	and	more	long.	In	this	case,	the	speculator
position	wasn’t	meaningfully	long	at	the	top.	But	then	the	market	came	down
5%,	and	everyone	got	long.	And	I	saw	the	same	thing	on	TV	where	everyone
was	 saying	 you	 have	 to	 buy	 the	 dip.	 Then	 the	 COT	 report	 came	 out,	 and	 it
showed	everyone	had	bought	the	dip.	It	was	the	largest	long	speculator	position
in	 years.	 That	 was	 when	 I	 realized	 that	 the	 market	 was	 a	 massive	 short,	 and
whatever	the	impact	of	the	virus	was,	it	was	going	to	get	a	lot	worse.

**I	 assume	 that	 was	 an	 atypical	 trade	 because	 even	 though	 you	 had	 an
extreme	COT	reading,	you	couldn’t	have	had	a	reversal	day	signal	here
since	the	market	had	already	declined	5%	from	the	high.	What	was	the
trigger	that	got	you	short?	Was	it	just	the	COT	reading?**

The	trigger	was	that	I	was	long	across	the	board.	I	have	a	system	for	trading
stock	indexes	that	I	don’t	use	very	often,	but	I	will	use	it	as	a	risk	mitigator	when
needed.	The	idea	is	that	if	NASDAQ,	a	higher	beta	index,	is	lagging	the	Dow,	a
lower	 beta	 index,	 when	 the	 market	 is	 up—which	 is	 not	 the	 price	 action	 you
would	 expect—and	 I’m	 long	 equity-correlated	 positions,	 then	 I	 will	 short
NASDAQ.	After	the	COT	report	came	out,	we	had	a	one-	or	two-day	bounce	in
which	the	NASDAQ	lagged	the	Dow.	That	price	action	was	enough	to	get	me
short	since	I	was	looking	for	an	offset	to	my	longs	anyway.

**Do	you	sometimes	put	on	trades	that	are	not	based	on	the	COT	numbers?**

Sometimes,	I	will	put	on	a	non-COT	trade.	The	COT	is	not	a	perfect	indicator.
There	has	never	been	and	will	never	be	a	perfect	indicator.	But,	because	I	have
lost	so	much	money	in	the	market	and	made	such	terrible	trades,	I	physically
cannot	put	on	a	non-contrarian	trade.

There	are	days	when	I’m	sitting	here,	and	everyone	on	TV	is	saying	the	same
thing:	“The	market	is	going	down.”	Then	I	get	a	call	from	someone	who	I	know


is	always	wrong,	and	he’s	telling	me	how	the	market	is	going	down.	Then	I’ll
see	something	on	LinkedIn	from	another	guy	who	is	wrong	all	the	time,	saying
the	same	thing.	This	type	of	day	will	happen	a	few	times	a	year.	And	while
everyone	is	saying	the	same	thing	about	how	bearish	the	market	is,	the	market	is
going	up,	and	it	doesn’t	make	sense.	I’ll	put	that	trade	on	because	I	have	seen	it
so	many	times.	It’s	all	that	I	do,	so	I	have	developed	an	instinct	for	those	types	of
situations.	I	think	intuition	is	just	experience.

**Do	 you	 think	 you	 have	 been	 successful	 because	 your	 inner	 core	 is
contrarian?**

Yes,	definitely.	Being	a	contrarian	is	instinctive	for	me.	I’ve	been	a	contrarian
since	I	was	a	kid.	It’s	part	of	my	DNA.	Fortunately	for	me,	it	is	a	valuable	trait	to
have	as	a	trader.	I	try	to	see	when	everyone	is	doing	the	same	thing,	and	I	go	the
opposite	way.	By	definition,	everyone	can’t	make	outsize	returns.	So	if	everyone
is	doing	something,	the	only	way	to	make	outsize	returns	is	by	being	on	the	other
side.	 The	 great	 thing	 about	 the	 markets	 is	 that	 I	 can	 wait	 until	 there	 is	 a
confirmation	before	taking	the	opposite	position.

**Do	the	lessons	you	have	learned	in	the	markets	spill	over	in	the	way	you	live
your	life?**

It	spills	over	in	every	way	I	live	my	life,	and	that’s	the	problem	[he	laughs].
Being	a	contrarian	works	in	the	markets,	but	it	doesn’t	work	in	social	situations.
People	want	to	be	liked;	they	want	to	be	part	of	a	group.	Being	a	contrarian
doesn’t	 win	 you	 any	 friends.	 It’s	 a	 lonely	 place	 to	 be.	 My	 wife	 calls	 me	 a
pathological	 contrarian.	 I’m	 not	 saying	 it’s	 healthy.	 I’m	 not	 saying	 everyone
should	live	that	way.

**Give	me	an	example	of	how	you	are	a	contrarian	outside	of	trading.**

I	get	into	arguments	with	my	friends	who	are	Democrats,	and	they	all	think	I	am
a	 conservative	 Republican.	 I	 get	 into	 arguments	 with	 my	 friends	 who	 are
Republicans,	and	they	all	think	I	am	a	bleeding	heart	liberal.	It’s	automatic	for
me	to	take	the	other	side.	People	get	into	such	one-sided	views	that	their	logic
disappears.	If	you	ask	me	on	a	personal	basis	whether	I	think	Donald	Trump	is
an	asshole,	yes,	I	think	he	is	an	asshole.	But	does	that	mean	every	single	thing	he
says	has	to	be	lambasted,	every	single	time?	That’s	illogical.

**OK,	I’ll	bite.	Give	me	an	example	of	something	Trump	said	that	he	was
lambasted	for	that	actually	was	right.**

He	said	he	would	win	the	election,	which	everyone	thought	was	ridiculous,	and
he	is	the	president.


**I	 assume	 when	 you	 argue	 with	 someone,	 whether	 they	 are	 liberal	 or
conservative,	 it	 is	 because	 you	 believe	 in	 the	 opposing	 view	 on	 that
particular	issue,	or	do	you	actually	argue	just	for	the	sake	of	it?**

Sometimes,	I	will	argue	just	for	the	sake	of	it	because	I	think	it	is	important	for
people	to	hear	the	other	side.

**So,	if	you	are	at	a	party	where	most	of	the	people	are	liberals,	you	will	argue
the	conservative	side,	and	if	you	are	at	a	party	where	most	of	the	people	are
conservatives,	you	will	argue	the	liberal	side.**

100%.	I	have	done	that	so	many	times,	I	can’t	even	tell	you.

**Besides	being	a	contrarian,	what	else	has	been	critical	to	your	success?**

I	succeeded	because	I	have	failed	so	many	times,	and	I	had	an	open	mind	about
failure	and	was	able	to	learn	from	it.	I	failed	because	I	sucked,	not	because	the
market	was	wrong	or	because	someone	screwed	me,	or	any	of	the	other	excuses
you	hear.

People	 fail,	 and	 they	 quit;	 they	 get	 scared.	 For	 some	 reason,	 I	 have	 a	 risk
instinct.	I	hate	failing,	but	I	don’t	mind	taking	the	risk	and	then	failing.	I	have	a
good	friend	who	is	a	wonderful	human	being.	His	risk	appetite	is	basically	zero.
He	is	a	lawyer,	making	a	good	living,	but	he	hates	what	he	is	doing.	He’ll	call
me	up	complaining	and	say,	“I	know	this	guy	is	guilty,	and	he	is	a	racist,	and	I
have	to	defend	him.”	I	tell	him,	“Why	don’t	you	just	quit,	take	your	money,	and
do	something	else.”	But	he	just	can’t	process	that.	And	I	can’t	process	not	doing
that.	Why	not	take	the	risk?	You’re	going	to	die	one	day	anyway.

**Is	your	approach	as	effective	now	as	it	was	20	years	ago	when	you	first
started	using	it,	or	has	it	been	affected	by	all	the	structural	changes	in	the
market	since	then?**

I	don’t	think	it’s	any	different	now	than	it	ever	was	in	history.	Everyone	is	short;
the	market	doesn’t	go	down	on	bad	news;	the	market	starts	to	go	up.	That	is	what
a	market	bottom	is.	The	market	doesn’t	bottom	on	good	news;	it	bottoms	on	bad
news.	Also,	there	is	a	sound	underlying	reason	why	the	COT	has	remained	and
should	remain	a	useful	indicator.

My	daughter	just	took	a	job	with	one	of	the	physical	commodity	companies.	She
doesn’t	 know	 any	 of	 this	 stuff.	 She	 didn’t	 study	 finance;	 she	 majored	 in
international	relations.	I	was	talking	to	her	recently.

“Let	me	ask	you	something,	Dad,”	she	says.	“I’m	learning	about	hedging.	If	they
[her	company]	own	mines,	then	they	know	what	the	supply	is,	right?”


I	answer,	“Yes.”

“And,	if	they	are	talking	to	customers	all	the	time,	then	they	know	what	demand
is,	right?”

I	answer,	“Yes.”

“Wouldn’t	they	have	inside	information	on	their	hedging	then?”

I	say,	“There	you	go!”	[He	claps	his	hands	as	he	says	this.]	“That’s	exactly	what
I	do.	They	are	the	commercials,	and	I	trade	on	the	same	side	they	do.”

“But	I	thought	you	did	your	own	thing,”	she	says.

I	say,	“That	 _is	my	own	thing_ .	 I’m	 going	 with	 the	 people	 who	 have	 the	 most
knowledge.	That’s	the	whole	point.”

**You	were	extremely	reluctant	to	do	this	interview.	In	fact,	you	turned	me
down	at	least	twice.	What	changed	your	mind?**

My	wife	is	continually	telling	me	that	I	should	write	a	book	with	my	ideas,	so
people	could	learn	from	it.	I	know	I	am	never	going	to	write	a	book.	So	I	think	it
is	a	good	idea	for	someone	to	write	down	these	concepts.	It’s	not	my	story	that	is
important	but	rather	the	idea	of	how	markets	really	work.	I	don’t	want	to	sound
pompous	like	I’m	the	only	one	who	understands	how	the	markets	work.	Some
people	get	it,	but	not	a	lot,	which	I	guess	is	fortunate.	If	everyone	agreed,	the
game	would	be	over.

If	I	have	any	message	to	the	world—and	it	is	the	reason	I	agreed	to	do	this
interview—it	is	to	convey	the	importance	of	participation.	Everyone	understands
that	the	market	is	a	discounting	mechanism.	What	they	don’t	realize	is	that	the
discounting	mechanism	is	not	price;	it’s	participation.	It’s	not	that	the	price	has
gone	 from	 50	 to	 100,	 and	 therefore	 the	 bullish	 fundamentals	 are	 discounted.
Instead,	 it’s	 everyone	 is	 long,	 and	 consequently,	 the	 bullish	 fundamentals	 are
discounted.	Amazon	stock	provides	a	great	example	of	this	principle.	When	it
reached	the	$700–$800	level,	everyone	thought	the	price	was	ridiculous.	There
was	lots	of	talk	about	Amazon	being	a	bubble.	It	was	clear,	though,	that	the
majority	of	people	did	not	own	it,	or	they	wouldn’t	be	calling	it	a	bubble.	The
stock	is	now	trading	above	$2,300.

The	critical	role	of	participation	is	a	concept	that	applies	well	beyond	trading.
An	 example	 I	 like	 to	 use,	 which	 is	 outside	 the	 sphere	 of	 trading,	 is	 football
betting.	If	you	have	the	best	team	in	the	NFL	playing	the	worst	team	in	the	NFL,
everyone	 knows	 who	 is	 probably	 going	 to	 win.	 But	 that	 is	 not	 what	 you	 are
betting	 on;	 you’re	 betting	 on	 the	 point	 spread.	 I	 don’t	 see	 how	 any	 type	 of


analysis	you	could	do	could	tell	you	whether	the	point	spread	is	overvalued	or
undervalued.	To	me,	the	answer	lies	in	participation.	If	everyone	is	betting	on
one	side,	then	the	point	spread	will	have	to	move,	and	it	will	probably	move	too
far.	In	fact,	I	have	a	football	betting	system	that	looks	at	30	guys	who	make	picks
versus	the	spread.	When	25	or	more	of	them	pick	the	same	team,	which	happens
only	about	six	times	a	year,	the	other	team	will	win	80%	of	the	time.	Now,	is	that
because	I	have	any	ability	to	pick	football	spreads	[he	laughs]?	No,	it’s	because
if	over	80%	of	the	guys	in	my	sample	are	choosing	the	same	team,	then	everyone
else	must	be	doing	the	same	thing	too,	and	the	point	spread	is	probably	too	wide.

The	 concept	 that	 a	 market’s	 discounting	 mechanism	 is	 based	 on	 speculator
participation,	not	price,	is	the	most	important	thing	that	I	know.

Given	 the	 developments	 of	 the	 past	 few	 decades—algorithmic	 trading,	 high-
frequency	trading,	artificial	intelligence,	the	proliferation	of	hedge	funds—is	it
still	possible	for	the	individual	trader	to	beat	the	market?	Jason	Shapiro	provides
the	perfect	illustration	of	why	I	believe	the	answer	to	this	question	is	“yes.”

At	its	core,	Shapiro’s	trading	success	is	grounded	in	exploiting	the	flaw	in	the
emotion-based	trading	decisions	of	other	market	participants.	Shapiro	seeks	to
go	short	at	times	when	bullish	euphoria	reigns	supreme	and	to	go	long	at	times
when	bearish	sentiment	has	become	prevalent.	It	is	noteworthy	that	the	efficacy
of	Shapiro’s	approach	has	not	deteriorated	one	iota	in	the	two	decades	he	has
used	it,	despite	all	the	significant	changes	that	have	occurred	during	that	time.
While	the	structure	of	markets,	the	nature	of	the	participants,	and	the	available
trading	tools	have	all	changed	dramatically	over	time,	the	one	thing	that	has	not
changed	is	human	emotion.	And	it	is	the	immutability	of	human	emotions	that
assures	that	trading	opportunities	will	continue	to	prevail,	notwithstanding	the
changes	above.

To	trade	like	Shapiro	requires	going	against	your	inherent	human	instincts.	You
need	to	be	able	to	sell	when	your	natural	instincts	would	be	more	inclined	to	fear
missing	out	on	a	soaring	bull	market,	and	to	buy	when	any	imminent	end	to	an
unrelenting	bear	market	seems	unimaginable.	Of	course,	by	itself,	going	short	in
a	 roaring	 bull	 market	 or	 long	 in	 an	 unabated	 bear	 market	 is	 an	 invitation	 to
financial	 ruin.	 As	 expressed	 in	 the	 famous	 adage	 of	 uncertain	 origin
(questionably	attributed	to	John	Maynard	Keynes),	“Markets	can	stay	irrational
longer	than	you	can	stay	solvent.”


To	 make	 a	 contrarian	 trading	 approach	 work,	 a	 method	 for	 timing	 entry	 into
markets	is	absolutely	critical.	There	are	two	essential	components	to	Shapiro’s
approach:

```
1 .	Taking	positions	counter	to	the	extremes	of	speculator	market	positioning;
2 .	Timing	the	entry	into	such	positions	based	on	market	action.
```
Shapiro	relies	primarily	on	the	weekly	Commitment	of	Traders	(COT)	report	to
determine	extremes	in	market	sentiment.	He	looks	to	be	on	the	opposite	side	of
extremes	 in	 speculator	 positioning,	 or	 equivalently,	 on	 the	 same	 side	 as
commercial	positioning.	As	a	supplemental	input,	he	will	also	use	financial	TV
shows.	So,	yes,	watching	financial	TV	programs	can	be	useful	in	your	trading
— _as	a	contrarian	indicator!_

For	timing	his	contrarian	positions,	Shapiro	will	look	for	market	reversals	that
occur	despite	a	preponderance	of	news	in	the	opposite	direction.	Markets	bottom
on	bearish	news	and	top	on	bullish	news.	Why?	Before	interviewing	Shapiro,	my
answer	to	this	question	would	have	been	that	fundamentals	are	only	bearish	or
bullish	 relative	 to	 price,	 and	 at	 some	 price,	 the	 news	 is	 fully	 discounted.
Although	 this	 answer	 is	 still	 valid,	 Shapiro	 has	 a	 better	 explanation:
participation.	Markets	bottom	because	speculators	are	already	fully	positioned
short—a	 condition	 that	 will	 naturally	 occur	 in	 an	 environment	 of	 pervasive
bearish	news.	A	similar	explanation	would	apply	to	market	tops.

Early	 in	 his	 trading	 career,	 Shapiro	 blew	 out	 his	 account	 twice:	 once	 by
assuming	a	bull	market	would	go	on	forever	and	once	by	fighting	a	bull	market.
The	common	denominator	in	these	opposite	circumstances	was	the	absence	of
risk	management	to	prevent	an	account-damaging	loss	on	one	wrong	idea.

If	there	is	one	absolute	in	Shapiro’s	trading	methodology,	it	is	that	he	will	have	a
stop-loss	on	every	position.	This	rule	will	prevent	substantial	losses	when	the
implications	of	the	COT	report	are	wrong.	Shapiro	will	select	a	stop	point	that
contradicts	his	hypothesis	that	the	market	has	bottomed	or	topped.

Risk	management	is	not	merely	essential	for	individual	trades,	it	needs	to	be
applied	at	the	portfolio	level	as	well.	Specifically,	traders	need	to	be	cognizant	of
those	times	when	markets	become	highly	correlated.	In	such	situations,	the	risk
for	any	given	portfolio	may	be	much	greater	than	normal	because	of	the	higher
probability	of	simultaneous	adverse	price	moves	in	multiple	positions.	Shapiro
manages	the	increased	risk	of	higher	correlation	markets	by	reducing	his	overall


position	size	and	by	seeking	inversely	correlated	trades	to	add	to	the	portfolio.

One	 of	 the	 most	 profitable	 periods	 in	 Shapiro’s	 early	 trading	 career	 occurred
when	he	went	on	a	three-week	vacation	in	Africa—a	trip	that	made	monitoring
his	market	position	impossible.	Before	leaving,	Shapiro	provided	his	broker	with
instructions	for	liquidating	his	position	in	the	event	of	an	adverse	price	move.
When	he	returned,	Shapiro	was	pleasantly	surprised	to	discover	that	his	position
had	accumulated	a	hefty	profit	while	he	was	gone.	By	not	being	able	to	watch
his	position,	Shapiro	avoided	the	temptation	to	take	profits,	which	was	hugely
beneficial.	He	realized	that	his	“sitting”	with	the	position	had	turned	out	to	be	far
more	profitable	than	his	daily	trading.	This	lesson	proved	long	lasting	and	is
manifested	in	the	trading	methodology	Shapiro	ultimately	developed.	If	Shapiro
is	not	stopped	out	of	a	trade,	he	will	hold	it	until	his	COT-based	oscillator	turns
neutral—an	approach	that	will	often	require	holding	a	position	for	months	and
through	multiple	market	gyrations.

I	 have	 frequently	 admonished	 traders	 not	 to	 listen	 to	 other	 people.	 As	 one
representative	 quote:	 “If	 you	 listen	 to	 anyone	 else’s	 opinion,	 no	 matter	 how

smart	or	skillful	the	trader	might	be,	I	guarantee	it	is	going	to	end	badly.”^11 	After
interviewing	Shapiro,	I	feel	that	I	need	to	include	a	qualification	in	that	prior
advice.	Namely,	if	you	know	or	can	identify	traders	or	commentators	who	are
reliably	 wrong—a	 task	 far	 easier	 than	 finding	 those	 who	 reliably	 right—then
their	opinions	could	well	be	useful	 _in	a	contrarian	sense_.

# Richard	Bargh: 	The	Importance	of	Mindset

# IT	is	ironic	that	although	Richard	Bargh	was	consistently	profitable	from	his	start

as	a	trader,	he	still	came	perilously	close	to	failing	several	times.	The	reasons
why	are	detailed	in	the	interview.	Bargh	began	his	career	trading	a	proprietary
account.	 Officially,	 the	 starting	 equity	 in	 his	 account	 was	 marked	 at	 zero.
Monthly	withdrawals	that	averaged	near	£3,000	kept	his	account	equity	within
£15,000	of	zero	for	the	first	14	months,	making	it	impossible	to	calculate	returns
for	 this	 period.	 Then,	 a	 giant	 winning	 trade	 permanently	 moved	 his	 account
equity	into	meaningful	positive	territory.

Bargh’s	annualized	return	for	the	six-plus	years	since	that	juncture	(the	last	4½
years	trading	his	own	account)	is	an	astounding	280%.	Bargh’s	average	return	is
amplified	by	the	fact	he	traded	his	futures	account	at	a	high	margin-to-equity
ratio,	keeping	a	much	smaller	amount	of	cash	in	excess	to	margin	requirements
in	his	account	than	is	typical	for	most	futures	traders.	However,	the	extremely
high	 margin-to-equity	 Bargh	 employed	 commensurately	 amplified	 all	 his	 risk
numbers	 as	 well.	 Therefore,	 it	 is	 noteworthy	 that	 Bargh	 achieved	 a	 280%
average	return	with	an	end-of-month	maximum	drawdown	of	only	11%	(19%
using	 daily	 data).	 As	 might	 be	 inferred	 from	 these	 two	 statistics,	 Bargh’s
return/risk	metrics	are	extraordinary:	adjusted	Sortino	ratio—25.1;	daily	Gain	to

Pain	ratio—2.3;	and	monthly	Gain	to	Pain	ratio—18.3.^12 	His	adjusted	Sortino
ratio	is	more	than	seven	times	as	high	as	his	Sharpe	ratio	(for	most	traders,	these
two	statistics	tend	to	be	reasonably	close),	implying	a	huge	 _positive	skew_ 	in	his
return	distribution	(that	is,	the	largest	gains	are	much	greater	than	the	largest
losses).

Bargh	maintains	a	spreadsheet	with	columns	for	different	attributes,	which	he
monitors	daily	in	a	self-awareness	ritual.	These	items	include	focus,	energy,	risk
management,	process,	counter	trading	(trading	against	the	price	move,	which	he
considers	 a	 negative),	 ego,	 fear	 of	 missing	 out,	 and	 happiness	 rating	 (either
extreme—depression	 or	 euphoria—being	 adverse	 for	 trading).	 Some	 entries
require	 further	 elaboration,	 such	 as	 “sugar	 trades.”	 _A	 sugar	 trade_ ,	 Bargh
explains,	is	a	trade	that	you	get	into,	and	you	don’t	even	know	why	you	are	in
the	trade.	When	Bargh	judges	that	he	has	exhibited	weakness	in	any	area,	he	will
fill	 in	 the	 appropriate	 column	 for	 that	 day.	 At	 the	 end	 of	 each	 week,	 Bargh
reviews	the	spreadsheet	looking	for	columns	with	any	fill-ins	as	a	roadmap	to
the	areas	he	needs	to	work	on	for	further	self-improvement.


Bargh	also	does	daily	journaling	to	record	what	he	is	thinking	and	feeling—a
routine	 that	 he	 considers	 essential	 to	 identifying	 weaknesses	 in	 his	 mindset,
which	 he	 then	 works	 on	 in	 his	 continuous	 quest	 for	 self-improvement.
Commenting	 on	 the	 importance	 of	 daily	 journaling,	 Bargh	 says,	 “You	 very
quickly	tend	to	forget	about	last	month,	last	week,	or	even	yesterday.	By	keeping
a	journal,	you	can	see	what	was	going	through	your	mind	at	any	point	in	time
and	 track	 how	 your	 mindset	 changes	 over	 time.	 If	 I	 showed	 you	 my	 journal
entries	from	2015	versus	now,	you	would	see	they	are	worlds	apart.	My	2015
entries	were	replete	with	comments	like,	‘I’m	a	crap	trader.	I’m	useless.’	All	I
was	 doing	 was	 constantly	 berating	 myself.	 My	 entries	 now	 are	 entirely
different.”

Bargh	credits	the	Trading	Tribe	Process	(TTP)	created	by	Ed	Seykota,	whom	I
interviewed	in	 _Market	Wizards_ ,	as	an	essential	influence	in	helping	him	achieve
emotional	 balance	 in	 both	 his	 trading	 and	 life	 overall.	 As	 a	 massive
oversimplification,	TTP	seeks	to	create	harmony	between	the	subconscious	and
conscious	 minds.	 The	 process	 focuses	 on	 feelings	 and	 specifically	 avoids
questions	and	advice.	TTP	requires	a	group,	which	is	called	a	 _tribe_ .	There	are
tribes	practicing	TTP	worldwide,	and	Bargh	runs	the	London	group.	Readers	can
find	a	detailed	description	of	TTP	at	seykota.com.

Bargh	was	the	first	of	a	week-long	set	of	interviews	I	conducted	in	London.	I
slept	only	three	hours	the	night	before	my	London	flight	and	then	less	than	two
hours	the	subsequent	night	in	London,	as	I	experienced	my	worst	case	of	jet	lag
ever.	 I	 was	 fortunate	 that	 Bargh’s	 honesty	 and	 forthrightness	 made	 this	 an
engaging	interview,	allowing	me	to	maintain	my	focus	despite	the	lack	of	sleep.	I
interviewed	Bargh	on	a	Saturday	in	a	conference	room	adjacent	to	the	trading
floor	where	he	works.	The	interview	lasted	the	full	day.	When	we	finished,	I	was
still	more	alert	than	I	had	any	right	to	be.	I	accepted	Bargh’s	dinner	invitation,
and	we	went	to	an	excellent	Peruvian	restaurant	(Coya),	just	down	the	block
from	his	office.	The	combination	of	the	chef’s	tasting	menu,	a	few	beers,	and	the
informal	conversation	made	for	a	pleasant	evening.	I	slept	soundly	that	night.

**Did	you	grow	up	in	London?**

No,	I	grew	up	in	Yorkshire	on	a	dairy	farm.

**At	what	age	did	you	know	you	wanted	to	do	something	different?**


One	day,	when	I	was	four	or	five	years	old,	I	turned	to	my	dad	and	said,	“You
don’t	have	a	real	job.	I	want	to	get	a	real	job.”	Funny	enough,	what	I’m	doing
now	is	not	a	real	job.

**So	since	you	were	a	small	child,	you	knew	you	wanted	to	do	something
different.	How	did	your	dad	respond?**

Oh,	he	was	fine	with	that.	He	always	said,	“Don’t	be	a	farmer.”

**When	 you	 were	 in	 your	 teen	 years,	 did	 you	 have	 any	 idea	 what	 you
eventually	wanted	to	do?**

All	I	knew	was	that	I	wanted	to	be	rich.	We	lived	in	a	village.	There	was	one
wealthy	family	in	the	village,	and	one	day	when	I	was	about	six	or	seven,	my
mom	took	me	to	visit	them.	We	didn’t	have	much	money,	and	when	I	saw	their
house,	I	thought	it	was	incredible.	They	even	had	an	outdoor	swimming	pool,
which	 is	 ridiculous	 in	 the	 north	 of	 England	 because	 it	 barely	 gets	 above	 20°
Celsius	 [68°	 Fahrenheit]	 in	 the	 summer.	 I	 remember	 walking	 away	 with	 my
mom	and	telling	her,	“I’m	going	to	buy	that	house	one	day.”	That	experience	set
my	ambition.	I	had	no	idea	how;	I	just	knew	that	I	wanted	to	be	rich.

The	 other	 thing	 that	 got	 me	 interested	 in	 trading	 was	 the	 movie	 about	 Nick
Leeson	[ _Rogue	Trader_ ],	who	broke	Barings	Bank.	The	part	about	him	being	a
shady	character,	of	course,	is	not	good.	But	I	remember	watching	him	on	the
trading	floor	with	all	the	shouting	and	screaming,	thinking,	“That	looks	so	cool.”

**How	old	were	you	then?**

I	was	in	my	young	teens.

**I	think	you	are	the	first	trader	I	ever	met	who	was	inspired	to	become	a
trader	by	that	movie.**

Yeah,	I	know.	It’s	not	good,	is	it?	[He	laughs.]	I	started	asking	my	mom	and	dad
about	how	you	make	money	in	currencies,	and	they	said,	“You’re	too	young	to
understand.”	I	never	took	it	any	further	than	that.

**What	did	you	major	at	in	school?**

I	got	a	Masters	in	math	from	Imperial	College	in	London.

**Were	you	naturally	good	at	math?**

Yes,	but	I	was	also	bad	at	writing	and	didn’t	enjoy	it.

**Did	you	have	any	idea	what	you	wanted	to	do	with	a	math	degree?**

No,	I	didn’t.

**Did	you	have	any	career	goal?**


I	 was	 still	 interested	 in	 trading,	 and	 I	 applied	 to	 banks	 for	 internships.	 But	 I
quickly	realized	that	I	was	way	behind	the	curve.	I	was	competing	against	people
who	had	been	doing	internships	all	through	their	college	years.	I	got	nowhere
with	 my	 efforts,	 and,	 after	 a	 while,	 I	 gave	 up.	 It	 was	 the	 aftermath	 of	 the
financial	crisis,	and	there	were	still	job	cuts	going	on	in	the	banking	sector.	The
year	before	I	graduated,	I	took	an	internship	for	an	actuarial	position	at	a	pension
company.

**I	guess	that	was	a	natural	extension	of	your	being	a	math	major.**

I	 thought	 it	 was	 something	 I	 could	 do,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 enjoy	 it	 all.	 I	 hated	 the
corporate	environment.	I	couldn’t	make	a	joke	because	everything	was	so	PC.	I
probably	offended	some	people	there,	and	I	didn’t	come	across	very	well.	On	top
of	that,	I	didn’t	put	much	effort	into	the	work	they	gave	me.

**Why	is	that?**

I	thought	the	actuarial	work	was	boring.	I	actually	don’t	like	statistics.

**So	what	kind	of	math	did	you	study	or	like?**

Applied	mathematics.

**What	happened	when	you	finished	your	internship?**

They	didn’t	offer	me	a	job.

**Do	you	remember	your	reaction?**

I	took	it	badly.	I	was	pretty	arrogant.	I	expected	the	firm	to	offer	me	a	job	at	the
end	of	my	internship	because	I	went	to	one	of	the	world’s	best	universities	and
was	smart.	I	thought,	“How	could	I	not	be	offered	a	job	here?”

**Is	Imperial	College	that	difficult	to	get	into?**

Yes,	at	the	time,	it	was	ranked	fourth	in	the	world.

**Did	they	tell	you	why	they	weren’t	offering	you	a	job?**

Yes,	they	said	something	like,	“It	didn’t	seem	like	you	were	that	interested	in	the
job.”

**Well,	they	were	right.**

Yes,	they	were	quite	right.	I	think	they	were	shocked	when	I	looked	upset	at	not
being	offered	the	job.	It	is	just	that	with	my	competitive	personality,	I	expected
to	get	the	job.	I	don’t	take	losing	or	rejection	very	well.

**So	what	did	you	do	then?**

I	know	this	sounds	clichéd,	but	I	thought	that	if	I	was	going	to	fail,	I	might	as
well	fail	at	something	I	wanted	to	do.	I	decided	to	give	trading	another	shot.


**And	your	goal	of	becoming	a	trader	was	primarily	motivated	by	a	desire	to
get	rich	quick?**

Yes.

**That’s	odd.	In	previous	** **_Market	Wizards_** **	books,	I	can’t	recall	other	traders
who	indicated	their	primary	motivation	to	get	into	trading	was	the	money.
Yet,	for	this	book,	you	are	the	second	trader	I	have	interviewed	so	far	who
mentioned	that	getting	rich	was	the	primary	motivation.**

I	raise	my	eyebrows	when	someone	says	that	something	else	was	their	primary
motivation	for	becoming	a	trader.

**Most	 commonly,	 the	 traders	 I	 interviewed	 in	 previous	 books	 mentioned
their	love	of	trading,	often	viewed	as	some	sort	of	game,	and	a	desire	to	beat
the	game	as	their	driving	motivation.**

I	have	never	looked	at	it	that	way.	I	never	felt	there	was	something	to	beat.	I	just
saw	it	as	a	way	to	enhance	the	quality	of	my	life.	I	don’t	feel	there	is	a	market	to
beat.	The	more	I	trade,	the	more	I	realize	that	the	only	thing	to	beat	is	myself.

**How	did	you	get	your	first	trading	job?**

I	worked	like	crazy	in	my	final	year	at	university.	I	applied	to	loads	of	banks
again,	and	I	got	rejected	by	all	of	them.	I	had	just	about	given	up	when	I	saw	this
job	posting	that	sounded	perfect	to	me.	You	got	to	trade	from	day	one.	You	were
backed	by	capital	and	got	a	split	on	profits.	That	sounded	great	because	if	I	went
to	a	bank,	I	wouldn’t	be	trading	from	day	one,	and	presumably	not	trading	the
way	I	wanted	to	trade.	Instead,	I	would	be	boxed	into	what	and	how	I	should
trade.	I	applied	online	and	got	an	interview.

**How	did	the	interview	go?**

I	almost	screwed	that	up	as	well.	I	was	interviewed	by	one	of	the	three	partners
in	 the	 firm	 who	 wanted	 to	 gauge	 my	 level	 of	 interest	 in	 the	 job	 and	 how
motivated	I	was.	At	that	point,	I	was	like	a	starved	dog.	I	was	desperate	to	get
the	job.	I	told	him	I	was	the	type	of	person	who	would	never	quit.

**That	all	sounds	fine.	Why	do	you	say	that	you	screwed	it	up?**

After	the	interview,	he	took	me	over	to	the	trading	desk	to	meet	the	other	two
partners	at	the	firm.	I	don’t	remember	this,	but,	apparently,	as	one	of	the	other
partners	was	speaking	to	me,	I	put	my	tie	in	my	mouth.	I	think	it	may	have	been
a	leftover	habit	of	mine	from	when	I	was	in	school.	When	I	was	very	focused	on
something,	I	would	put	my	tie	in	my	mouth.	After	I	left,	the	partner	at	the	desk
said,	“We	can’t	hire	him.”	The	guy	who	interviewed	me	convinced	his	partner	to


give	me	another	chance.	So	I	got	invited	back	again	for	another	interview,	and,
luckily,	I	was	able	to	persuade	them	that	I	wasn’t	a	complete	idiot.

**That	tie	habit	is	probably	something	you	do	unconsciously.**

Yes,	entirely	unconsciously.	I	only	found	out	about	it	years	later	when	one	of
them	made	a	joke	about	it.

**Did	you	know	anything	about	trading	or	the	markets	when	you	interviewed
for	the	job?**

I	knew	absolutely	nothing.	I	never	traded	my	own	account	because	I	felt	I	would
build	bad	habits.	And	I	am	glad	I	didn’t	do	it.	I	thought	I	needed	someone	to
teach	me	how	to	trade.

**Didn’t	 the	 firm	 care	 about	 your	 complete	 lack	 of	 knowledge	 and
experience?**

They	were	more	interested	in	finding	people	who	were	hungry	to	make	money
rather	than	people	with	experience.	Based	on	my	background,	they	also	knew
that	 I	 was	 smart	 enough	 to	 grasp	 anything	 relevant	 to	 markets.	 I	 think	 they
believed	that	personality	was	more	important	to	being	a	good	trader	than	what
you	knew	about	markets.

**Once	you	started	the	job,	how	did	you	learn	to	trade?**

The	standard	procedure	for	the	firm	was	to	take	on	two	trading	trainees	each
year.	The	first	two	weeks	were	an	intensive	training	course	where	you	came	in	at
6	a.m.,	and	the	instruction	lasted	until	4	p.m.	They	taught	us	how	to	use	the
trading	software.	They	also	taught	us	about	fundamentals,	such	as	understanding
how	critical	central	banks	were	to	moving	the	markets.	Their	business	model
was	trading	event	risk.	They	would	work	out	an	expectation	for	each	event,	such
as	 a	 Federal	 Reserve	 announcement,	 and	 then	 if	 the	 Fed	 did	 something
unexpected,	they	would	trade	the	event	and	try	to	make	a	profit.	By	the	time	I
arrived,	 however,	 the	 firm	 was	 trying	 to	 diversify	 away	 from	 that	 approach
because	all	the	traders	were	doing	mostly	the	same	thing.	In	the	past,	they	had	a
few	 traders	 who	 were	 exceptional	 at	 trading	 intraday	 technical	 analysis.	 In
hindsight,	I	think	they	were	hoping	that	I	would	be	good	at	pattern	day	trading.

**Did	they	teach	you	anything	about	how	to	use	technical	analysis	in	trading?**

One	of	the	partners	used	technical	analysis.	He	taught	us	how	to	identify	support
and	 resistance	 levels	 using	 Fibonacci	 retracements,	 trendlines,	 and	 other
indicators.	The	basic	concept	was	that	you	would	put	in	your	bid	at	a	technical
level	of	support	and	place	a	stop	five	or	six	ticks	lower,	hoping	you	would	get	a


20-tick	 bounce	 out	 of	 it.	 The	 firm	 would	 tell	 us,	 “Focus	 on	 the	 technicals
because	the	fundamentals	are	easy.”	Being	quite	green	to	it	all,	I	believed	it.	I
thought,	 “Yeah,	 I’m	 going	 to	 make	 money	 as	 a	 technical	 trader.	 Screw	 the
fundamentals;	they’re	easy.”

**Which	markets	were	you	trading?**

The	firm	traded	futures	markets,	primarily	currencies,	bonds,	and	stock	indexes.

**When	did	you	start	trading?**

Typically,	trainees	spent	the	first	six	months	on	a	simulator.	The	firm	monitored
your	P/L.	They	wanted	to	see	that	you	were	consistent	before	they	let	you	trade
real	money.	They	made	it	very	competitive	between	myself	and	the	other	trading
trainee.	They	switched	the	guy	who	started	with	me	to	trading	real	money	after
only	two	months.	I	was	left	trading	on	the	simulator	for	the	full	six	months,	and
that	was	hard	to	take.	There	were	some	excellent	markets	during	the	time	I	was
trading	on	the	simulator,	and	the	other	new	hire	was	trading	real	money.	During
that	period,	the	Swiss	Bank	pegged	its	currency,	which	was	a	huge	event,	and
there	were	also	coordinated	central	bank	rate	cuts.

**I	 assume	 you	 made	 money	 during	 the	 simulation	 period	 since	 they
eventually	gave	you	money	to	trade.**

I	found	the	first	six	months	very	difficult	because	of	extreme	paranoia.	People
used	to	joke	about	how	I	was	only	a	few	days	away	from	getting	fired.	They
would	try	to	rile	you	up,	and	I	took	that	to	heart.

**How	were	you	doing	on	the	simulator?**

I	was	making	money,	but	I	didn’t	know	if	that	was	good	enough	for	them.

**Were	you	trading	on	both	fundamental	events	and	technicals?**

My	profits	were	coming	mostly	from	technicals.

**What	kind	of	technical	analysis	were	you	using?**

We	learned	about	this	pattern	called	the	“open	drive.”	The	pattern	forms	when
the	market	 gaps	and	 then	 drives	in	 that	direction.	 The	 assumption	is	 that	 the
market	will	continue	to	drive	in	the	same	direction.

**Does	that	pattern	still	work,	or	did	it	just	work	then?**

I	think	I	was	just	lucky	with	using	that	approach	at	that	time,	which	allowed	me
to	make	money	on	the	simulator.	As	soon	as	my	trading	went	live,	I	never	made
a	penny	off	of	intraday	technical	trading.	For	about	four	years,	I	tried	to	make	it
work.	It	was	stupid.	I	was	so	stubborn.

**But	you	did	make	money	in	those	years.**


Although	 my	 main	 focus	 was	 on	 technical	 analysis,	 I	 was	 still	 making
fundamental	trades,	and	those	trades	accounted	for	almost	all	the	gains.

**Were	you	more	attracted	to	technical	trading	than	fundamental	trading?**

Initially,	I	was.

**Why?**

I	thought	the	firm	wanted	us	to	focus	on	becoming	good	technical	traders.

**Was	that	because	they	didn’t	want	people	to	duplicate	the	same	trades?**

Yes,	it	was	because	they	wanted	more	diversification	among	their	traders.

**So,	was	your	initial	focus	on	technical	analysis	a	matter	of	trying	to	please
your	bosses?**

I	think	so.	Also,	because	I	was	so	naïve,	I	thought	that	if	my	boss	could	trade	this
way,	so	could	I.	He	had	a	gift	for	intraday	technical	trading,	which	I	didn’t.

**Did	the	firm	give	you	an	amount	of	money	to	trade?**

They	 didn’t	 actually	 give	 you	 a	 line	 of	 money	 to	 trade.	 In	 the	 employment
contract,	there	was	a	£10,000	stop-out	point.	In	theory,	if	you	lost	£10,000,	you
were	out.

**How	were	you	paid?**

You	would	get	50%	of	trading	profits,	but	you	had	to	pay	a	desk	rent	of	about
£2,500	per	month.	The	desk	rent	covered	stuff	like	Reuters	and	trading	software.
They	gave	you	the	first	three	months	for	free.

One	 thing	 I	 didn’t	 mention	 that	 is	 important	 is	 that	 I	 had	 been	 dealing	 with
depression	since	secondary	school	[ages	12	to	16].	During	the	simulation	period,
I	 realized	 that	 I	 was	 only	 going	 to	 be	 good	 at	 trading	 if	 I	 became	 happy.	 I
recognized	early	on	how	mentally	tough	trading	could	be,	and	I	thought	that	if	I
was	not	mentally	right,	I	had	no	chance	of	succeeding	in	trading.	From	that	point
on,	I	spent	a	lot	of	time	focusing	on	trying	to	be	happy.

**How	do	you	do	that?**

I	read	an	excellent	book	that	I	recommend	to	anyone	who	has	a	problem	with
being	unhappy:	 _Depressive	Illness:	The	Curse	of	the	Strong_ 	by	Tim	Cantopher.
Something	about	that	book	was	very	therapeutic	and	resonated	with	what	I	was
going	through.	It	allowed	me	to	start	a	journey	towards	becoming	happier.	In	the
book,	the	author	describes	how	you	can	chart	getting	out	of	depression.	In	the
chart,	time	is	on	the	x-axis,	and	happiness	is	on	the	y-axis.	You	tend	to	go	like
this	when	you’re	coming	out	of	it.	[Bargh	draws	a	string	of	upward	trending


scallops	with	his	hand	waving	through	the	air.]	Essentially,	he	is	trying	to	tell
you	that	you	can’t	expect	to	go	from	zero	to	happy	in	a	straight	line.	It	takes
time.	You	start	out	very	unhappy;	your	happiness	improves;	you	drop	back	down
but	to	a	slightly	higher	level	than	before.	What	particularly	resonated	with	me	is
that	the	author	described	how	many	people	who	get	depressed	tend	to	be	quiet,
ambitious,	and	hard-working.	That	description	fits	my	personality	very	well.

**Can	you	recall	what	it	was	about	the	book	that	helped	you	get	out	of	your
unhappy	state?**

It	resonated	with	me	because	it	made	me	feel	that	I	was	not	alone.	It	helped	me
understand	that	the	same	thing	happens	to	other	people,	and	there	is	a	strategy
for	getting	out	of	it.

**How	did	you	get	out	of	that	mental	state?**

I	got	out	of	it	by	brute	force	self-talk.	I	remember	sitting	on	the	bus	back	from
work	and	thinking,	“You	have	got	to	be	happy!	You	have	got	to	be	happy!”	I
psyched	myself	up	to	get	out	of	it.	I	found	that	if	I	didn’t	do	that,	I	would	slide
back	into	a	hole,	and	it	is	tough	to	get	out	of	a	hole.

**In	a	sense,	did	trading	save	you	in	that	you	realized	you	weren’t	going	to	be
successful	unless	you	were	in	a	proper	mental	state?	Did	that	give	you	the
motivation	that	you	didn’t	have	before?**

It	definitely	gave	me	motivation.

**Was	trading	the	catalyst	for	getting	that	book?**

Yes.	It	took	many	years	to	get	completely	out	of	feeling	unhappy.	I	haven’t	had	a
depressive	episode	for	about	three	years.	It	never	entirely	leaves	you,	though.
You	never	forget.

**What	was	your	mental	state	at	the	time	you	started	trading	real	money?**

Mentally,	I	was	all	over	the	place	for	years,	mainly	because	of	the	pressure	of	not
getting	a	salary.	Essentially,	you	have	a	mindset	that	you	have	to	make	money
trading.

**What	were	your	trading	results	in	the	first	year?**

I	made	about	£20,000	in	2012,	but	I	was	negative	on	the	year	when	you	factor	in
all	the	costs.

**You	made	£20,000	with	a	£10,000	risk	line.	That’s	actually	pretty	good	for
the	first	year	of	trading.**

I	guess	so,	but	I	never	really	viewed	it	that	way.	I	saw	it	as,	“I’m	not	very	good
at	this.”


**But	you	were	only	negative	because	of	the	expenses.**

That	was	one	of	the	things	that	kept	me	going.	I	always	felt	that,	since	I	was
making	 money,	 all	 I	 had	 to	 do	 was	 beat	 the	 expenses.	 So,	 I	 knew	 there	 was
something	there,	and	that	I	had	some	kind	of	ability.

**In	2012,	you	made	money	but	didn’t	cover	your	expenses.	What	happened
in	2013?**

At	the	start	of	the	year,	my	bosses	reset	my	account	to	zero,	so	it	would	no
longer	show	a	negative	amount.	During	the	first	half	of	2013,	my	trading	was
profitable	but	not	by	enough	to	fully	cover	the	monthly	expenses.

**Since	you	weren’t	making	enough	in	trading	to	even	cover	your	monthly
office	charges,	let	alone	get	a	profit	split,	how	were	you	paying	your	living
expenses?**

I	was	living	off	of	savings.	I	had	saved	the	money	that	I	made	from	the	summer
jobs	 I	 had	 been	 doing	 for	 years.	 Since	 I	 lived	 on	 a	 farm,	 I	 didn’t	 have	 a
temptation	to	spend	much,	and	I	saved	most	of	the	money	I	made.

**What	kind	of	jobs?**

When	I	was	16,	I	got	a	job	as	a	waiter,	but	I	was	awful	at	it.	I	was	very	clumsy.	I
would	drop	dirty	knives	and	forks	on	people.	I	got	sacked	at	that	job.	After	that,
I	had	a	job	of	putting	up	tents	at	events	like	weddings.	I	was	very	good	at	that
job	because	I	am	so	tall	[Bargh	is	6’8”].

**Were	your	savings	from	summer	jobs	enough	to	live	on?**

I	had	also	saved	money	from	my	intern	job.	Also,	my	parents	helped	out	by
paying	my	rent,	and	I	paid	my	other	expenses	from	my	savings.

**Speaking	of	that,	how	did	your	parents	feel	about	your	taking	a	job	that	had
no	income?**

They	weren’t	too	happy	about	it.

**Did	they	try	to	talk	you	out	of	it?**

Eventually,	they	did.	By	mid-2013,	I	had	used	up	almost	all	my	savings.	I	told
my	parents	that	I	had	only	enough	savings	left	to	cover	one	month	of	expenses.
My	parents	were	genuinely	concerned.	They	didn’t	want	to	be	financing	what
they	thought	was	a	gambling	addiction.	They	said,	“We’re	not	going	to	continue
supporting	you.	You	need	to	sort	it	out	and	get	a	real	job.”

**What	was	your	performance	for	the	year	at	that	point?**

As	of	the	end	of	July,	my	gross	profits	were	£26,000.


**£26,000	on	a	£10,000	risk	line	is	pretty	good	performance.**

Maybe,	but	one	thing	the	return	statistics	don’t	show	is	missed	trades.	I	made	my
money	 mostly	 by	 trading	 events,	 and	 with	 the	 ongoing	 European	 debt	 crisis,
there	were	many	opportunities	to	make	money	trading	events.	Monetary	policy
was	 changing	 a	 lot	 in	 those	 days,	 forward	 guidance	 was	 introduced,	 and
quantitative	easing	was	restarted.	There	were	so	many	events	to	trade,	and	I	kept
screwing	up.	I	wasn’t	well	prepared	for	them.	It	was	a	vicious	cycle	of	missing	a
trade,	feeling	like	crap	for	missing	the	trade,	and	then	watching	everyone	else
making	loads	of	money	off	of	it.

**Did	you	feel	like	a	failure	at	that	point?**

Massively.

**That’s	 ironic	 because,	 objectively,	 you	 were	 doing	 very	 well	 in	 percent
return	terms,	excluding	the	expenses	being	charged	against	your	account.**

My	 theory	 is	 that	 for	 human	 beings,	 everything	 is	 relative.	 You	 are	 always
comparing	yourself	with	everyone	else.

**If	you	felt	like	a	failure,	did	you	consider	giving	up	and	doing	something
else?**

Even	when	I	felt	like	a	failure	and	that	I	was	bad	at	trading,	I	could	never	think
of	anything	that	I	would	rather	do	than	being	a	trader.	I	still	really	enjoyed	it	and
wanted	to	make	it	work.	So	it	was	tough	being	in	a	situation	where	I	was	almost
out	of	money,	and	I	felt	that	my	parents	were	giving	up	on	me.	I	didn’t	think
getting	a	part-time	job	was	a	good	idea	because	I	was	spending	all	my	energy	on
trading.	I	felt	that	if	I	got	a	part-time	job,	I	would	get	even	worse	at	trading.

**What	did	you	do?**

I	spoke	to	the	bosses	and	told	them	straight	up	what	the	situation	was.	I	said,	“I
am	out	of	cash,	and	I	don’t	know	how	much	longer	I	can	keep	doing	this.	Is	there
anything	you	can	do	to	try	to	help	me	out?”	And	they	did!	It	was	amazing.	They
said,	“We’ll	pay	you	a	salary.	How	much	do	you	need?”

**How	much	did	they	give	you?**

They	gave	me	a	salary	that	was	enough	to	cover	my	monthly	office	expenses.	I
later	found	out	that	my	bosses	took	Amrit	to	dinner	to	get	his	opinion	on	me.
[Amrit	Sall,	who	is	interviewed	in	Chapter	4,	had	started	at	the	same	firm	a	few
years	earlier.]	They	said,	“He	looks	like	he’s	struggling.	We’re	not	really	sure
about	him.	What	do	you	think?”	And	Amrit	told	them,	“I	think	he’s	going	to
make	it.”	It	was	Amrit’s	backing	that	convinced	them	to	give	me	a	salary.	Once	I


got	that	salary,	I	thought	I	had	till	Christmas	to	push	my	trading	to	more	than
cover	the	monthly	costs.	And,	luckily,	I	did.

[I	interviewed	Amrit	the	next	day	and	asked	him	about	this	episode	and	why	he
believed	Richard	would	succeed.	He	replied,	“Richard	is	a	hard	worker.	He	has
an	amazing	work	ethic.	If	you	are	that	committed	to	something	and	keep	your
focus	on	that	one	task,	it’s	only	a	matter	of	time	before	it	starts	working	for	you.
He	is	that	guy.	He	plugs	away.	He	is	proactive	about	dealing	with	anything	that
is	holding	him	back.”]

**Why	did	they	ask	Amrit?**

Amrit	 was	 one	 of	 their	 most	 successful	 traders,	 and	 I	 think	 they	 valued	 his
opinion.	I	didn’t	really	know	Amrit	at	the	time.	I	sat	in	another	part	of	the	office.
I	had	barely	spoken	to	him.

Several	years	later,	though,	Amrit	did	become	a	mentor.	He	helped	drive	into	me
the	importance	of	mindset	in	trading.	Amrit	helped	me	realize	that	I	was	getting
in	 my	 own	 way.	 I	 was	 always	 a	 glass-half-empty	 type	 of	 guy,	 and	 I	 would
continually	 beat	 myself	 up	 for	 making	 mistakes.	 Amrit	 kept	 saying	 to	 me,
“Look,	you	can’t	think	that	way.	You	are	only	going	to	trade	well	if	you	have	a
good	mindset.”

**Did	 your	 concern	 about	 losing	 your	 trading	 position	 diminish	 once	 you
started	receiving	a	salary?**

Not	right	away.	I	thought	I	had	bought	myself	some	time	and	had	till	Christmas
to	push	my	trading	to	more	than	cover	my	monthly	costs.	By	the	end	of	October,
I	was	up	about	£40,000	for	the	year,	which	may	sound	OK,	but	I	didn’t	feel	good
at	all	because	my	account	was	still	negative	once	you	factored	in	the	office	costs
and	my	salary	draw.	I	thought	that	I	didn’t	have	much	time	left.

**So,	as	of	the	end	of	October	2013,	you	still	thought	that	your	trading	career
could	end	that	year.**

Yes,	barring	some	miracle.

**What	happened?**

In	November	2013,	the	general	market	expectations	were	that	Mario	Draghi,	the
president	of	the	European	Central	Bank	(ECB),	would	cut	rates	in	December,	but
not	as	early	as	November.	I	was	praying	he	would	cut	rates	in	November.

**Why,	because	that	would	be	a	surprise?**

Yes,	because	that	would	be	a	surprise,	and	I	thought	I	could	make	good	money
on	it.	I	know	this	sounds	like	a	cliché,	but	I	remember	thinking,	“If	there	is	a


God,	please,	this	could	be	my	last	chance.”	When	Draghi	announced	a	rate	cut
after	 the	 ECB’s	 monthly	 meeting,	 I	 immediately	 bought	 several	 hundred
European	short-term	interest	rate	futures	contracts.

**How	were	you	able	to	take	such	a	large	position	given	your	modest	risk
line?**

My	bosses	assigned	position	limits	based	on	their	confidence	in	the	trader	and
the	level	they	thought	the	trader	could	handle.	They	had	seen	that	I	was	making
money	throughout	the	year	and	had	raised	my	limit.	The	trade	was	simple.	I
aggressively	bought	short-term	interest	rate	futures	and	exited	the	position	when
the	rate	cut	was	priced	in.	I	made	nearly	£90,000	on	that	trade.

**It	may	have	been	simple,	but	it	was	a	perfect	trade.	You	had	anticipated	the
possibility	of	the	trade.	You	were	utilizing	the	methodology	you	believed	in
—betting	on	an	event—instead	of	using	technicals.	You	were	ready	for	the
trade,	and	you	put	on	the	maximum	position	size.	You	did	everything	right
on	that	trade.	It	was	your	first	giant	winning	trade.	How	did	it	feel?**

It	felt	incredible.	I	remember	thinking,	“I	have	saved	myself.	Now	I	can	turn	this
into	a	career.”	Amazingly—and	this	is	what	made	it	so	sweet—my	parents	were
visiting	me	that	same	night.	I	took	them	out	for	a	meal.

**They	didn’t	know	anything	until	the	meal?**

No,	they	didn’t.

**You	had	been	doing	better.	Did	they	even	know	that	much?**

No,	they	just	knew	I	was	getting	backed	by	some	guys	at	work.

**So,	they	had	no	idea.	Your	parents	thought	you	were	probably	near	the	end
of	your	trading	job.**

Yes,	they	did.

**How	did	you	tell	them	what	happened?**

I	just	told	them	that	I	made	£90,000	that	day.	They	couldn’t	believe	it.	It	was	a
great	moment.

**Did	that	change	their	perspective	on	trading?**

I	think	so,	but	I	don’t	talk	to	them	about	trading	anymore	because	my	mom	is	a
big	worrier.

**After	that	trade,	did	you	feel	you	were	now	set?**

Yeah,	but	every	time	I	feel	like	I	am	set	in	this	game,	something	strikes	me	back
down.


**The	market	will	do	that.	Did	that	trade	get	you	off	of	using	technicals,	or
were	you	still	trying	to	make	technicals	work?**

I	was	still	trying	to	make	technicals	work,	but,	by	that	point,	the	majority	of	my
focus	was	on	getting	better	on	the	fundamentals.	On	paper,	the	method	is	really
simple.	You	work	out	what	will	move	the	market.	You	find	your	trade,	and	you
execute.	What	stops	traders	from	performing	well	is	themselves.	Most	of	my
problem	was	psychological.	I	would	have	a	good	day,	become	complacent,	and
then	 be	 unprepared	 for	 the	 next	 event,	 which	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 an	 excellent
trading	opportunity.	It	was	hit	and	miss.

I	am	much	better	now,	but	there	are	also	far	fewer	opportunities	now	than	back
in	 2013	 and	 2014.	 Back	 then,	 many	 things	 were	 still	 relatively	 new,	 like
quantitative	 easing	 and	 forward	 guidance.	 There	 was	 more	 uncertainty	 about
what	 the	 central	 banks	 were	 going	 to	 do	 and	 how	 they	 were	 going	 to	 do	 it.
Whereas	now,	the	markets	have	central	banks	so	nailed	down	that	there	is	not	as
much	opportunity	to	make	money	on	central	bank	actions	as	there	once	was.	The
markets	now	are	good	at	pricing	in	events	before	they	happen.	I	make	money	by
pricing	in	a	surprise,	and	with	fewer	surprises,	there	are	fewer	opportunities.	You
can	still	make	money	on	these	events,	but	you	have	to	do	it	differently.	You	have
to	be	smarter	about	how	you	do	it.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example?**

I	don’t	want	to	get	into	that;	that’s	more	proprietary.

**Fair	enough.	You	mentioned	that,	in	later	years,	Amrit	acted	as	a	mentor.
Did	you	have	any	other	mentors	at	the	firm?**

You	are	interviewing	Daljit,	aren’t	you?	[Daljit	Dhaliwal,	who	is	interviewed	in
Chapter	5,	started	as	a	trader	in	the	same	firm	a	couple	of	years	before	Bargh.]

**Yes,	I	am.**

I	sat	next	to	Daljit.	In	those	early	trading	years,	he	was	the	only	person	I	spoke
to.

**Did	he	help	you?**

There	were	both	good	and	bad	aspects	to	it,	but,	on	balance,	I	would	say	that	it
was	mostly	good.

**What	was	good,	and	what	was	bad?**

Daljit	 was	 incredibly	 motivated.	 I	 don’t	 think	 I	 ever	 met	 anybody	 more
motivated	than	Daljit.	He	was	very	good	at	understanding	what	moved	markets.
He	gave	me	tips	here	and	there,	which	helped	me	out.


**Can	you	give	me	an	example?**

Because	he	did	intensive	fundamental	research,	he	was	very	good	at	anticipating
market	events.	He	would	say	something	like,	“There’s	going	to	be	a	coordinated
rate	cut.	Be	prepared	for	it.”	Whereas	I,	at	the	time,	was	more	focused	on	trading
technicals	because	I	had	been	told	by	the	bosses	to	shy	away	from	fundamentals.
However,	without	making	money	on	fundamental	trades	here	and	there,	thanks
to	Daljit’s	help,	I	wouldn’t	have	made	most	of	the	profits	I	did	make.

**That	all	sounds	very	positive.	What	was	the	bad	side	of	having	Daljit	as	a
mentor?**

I	wouldn’t	blame	Daljit	for	it,	but	we	were	encouraged	to	be	aggressive	as	a
group.	 To	 build	 your	 account,	 you	 have	 to	 be	 aggressive.	 Daljit	 was	 always
pushing	me	to	do	more	size.	I	would	take	his	advice	too	literally.	I	would	take	a
30-lot	position	in	the	Bund	and	sit	there	petrified	because	if	I	got	it	wrong,	I
would	be	cooked.	But	what	I	really	should	have	been	doing	is	trading	five-lots
and	building	up	confidence	over	time.

**Did	you	then	put	on	larger	position	size	trades	than	you	otherwise	would
have	because	of	that	influence?**

Actually,	 it	 worked	 exactly	 the	 opposite	 way.	 I	 ended	 up	 not	 trading	 a	 lot
because	I	felt	that	when	I	did	put	on	a	trade,	I	had	to	put	it	on	in	large	size.	Then
when	the	moment	came	to	put	on	a	trade,	I	wouldn’t	do	anything.

**Was	that	because	you	saw	the	choice	as	being	between	making	a	very	large
trade	or	doing	nothing?**

Exactly.	I	would	end	up	doing	nothing	because	I	was	too	afraid	to	lose.	I	am	not
blaming	it	on	Daljit	because	he	would	tell	me	that	I	needed	to	trade	more.	He
was	trading	a	lot	and	learning	a	lot.	One	of	my	regrets	is	that	I	didn’t	trade	more.
I	was	pushing	my	size	to	levels	that	were	more	than	I	could	comfortably	handle,
which	made	me	afraid	to	trade.	I	wasn’t	trading,	and	by	not	trading,	I	wasn’t
getting	experience.

**Interestingly,	 you,	 Amrit,	 and	 Daljit	 all	 know	 each	 other,	 and	 I	 am
interviewing	 all	 of	 you	 for	 this	 book.	 I	 don’t	 think	 I	 have	 had	 that
circumstance	 before	 except	 for	 Marcus	 and	 Kovner	 in	 the	 first	** **_Market
Wizards_** **	book.**

And	Seykota	as	well.

**Yes,	you’re	quite	right.	Seykota	was	a	mentor	to	Marcus,	who	then	later
hired	Kovner.	So	that	was	another	instance	of	three	connected	traders	in**


**one	book.**

I	just	recently	reread	the	Marcus	interview	to	get	a	sense	of	how	you	write.	It	is
interesting	 how	 new	 things	 pop	 up	 when	 you	 reread	 one	 of	 those	 interviews
years	later.	It	seems	like	with	more	experience,	you	see	things	in	a	different	light.
One	 of	 the	 trades	 Marcus	 discussed	 in	 that	 interview	 was	 a	 long	 soybean
position	in	which	he	got	out	early,	but	Ed	Seykota	stayed	in,	and	then	soybeans
proceeded	to	go	limit	up	day	after	day	after	day.

**Yes,	I	recall	that	well.	Interestingly,	despite	Marcus	losing	money	repeatedly
in	 his	 early	 trading	 years,	 my	 impression	 was	 that	 his	 most	 painful
experience	 was	 not	 any	 of	 the	 losing	 trades	 but	 rather	 missing	 that
opportunity.**

I	never	appreciated	the	pain	of	missing	out	until	I	experienced	it	myself.	I’ve	had
a	12%	down	day,	and	even	that	was	not	as	bad.	It’s	a	different	feeling	when	you
miss	a	great	trade	opportunity.	It’s	awful.	I	struggle	with	it.

**Was	there	one	such	missed	trade	that	was	particularly	painful?**

I	mentioned	earlier	that	I	was	still	on	the	simulator	when	the	Swiss	National
Bank	 pegged	 its	 currency	 to	 the	 euro.	 Well,	 ironically,	 I	 also	 missed	 them
dropping	the	peg	in	January	2015.	Up	until	that	point	in	my	career,	I	had	worked
from	6:30	to	16:30,	like	clockwork.	I	hardly	ever	left	the	office	during	the	day.	I
even	brought	in	food	and	ate	at	my	desk.	That	evening	I	was	scheduled	to	fly	to
America	to	attend	a	trading	conference.	I	left	the	office	when	the	bank	opened	to
pick	up	some	USD.	There	was	a	problem	with	my	card,	and	I	spent	about	an
hour	at	the	bank	trying	to	get	the	problem	sorted	out.	When	I	returned	to	the
office,	everyone	looked	completely	shell-shocked,	and	a	coworker	who	sat	next
to	me	told	me	what	had	happened.	That	was	one	of	the	best	risk/reward	trade
opportunities	in	my	trading	career,	and	I	missed	it.	I	was	heartbroken.

**You	mentioned	Daljit	was	an	early	mentor.	Did	any	of	your	three	bosses	give
you	advice	or	any	other	feedback?**

They	were	reasonably	hands-off,	although	they	did	monthly	reviews.

**What	did	they	tell	you?**

They	had	started	on	the	LIFFE	floor	before	switching	to	screen	trading,	and	that
experience	still	influenced	them.	They	would	say	things	like,	“You	need	to	be
more	consistent.	Try	to	make	£100	a	day.”	I	never	really	thought	that	is	how
trading	worked.	It’s	more	like	you	make	nothing	for	a	while,	then	you	have	a
spurt.


**That	is	what	your	record	eventually	ended	up	looking	like.	So	you	are	quite
right	about	that.	What	was	working	for	you	in	those	early	years?**

I	had	a	couple	of	big	wins.	The	first	one	was	a	short	crude	oil	trade.	At	the	time,
oil	prices	were	very	high,	and	I	was	on	the	lookout	for	a	potential	release	from
the	US	Strategic	Petroleum	Reserve.	I	was	just	waiting	for	it	to	happen.	I	don’t
remember	 if	 they	 did	 it,	 or	 there	 was	 just	 talk	 about	 a	 release,	 but	 the	 news
caused	oil	prices	to	move	a	few	dollars	lower.	I	was	able	to	make	£7,000	on	that
trade.	 I	 remember	 coming	 home	 and	 telling	 my	 girlfriend	 (who	 is	 now	 my
fiancé),	“I	just	made	£7,000	today!”	I	quickly	learned	to	stop	coming	home	and
telling	her	about	my	P&L.	I	didn’t	want	to	put	my	pressures	on	her.	Then	I	had
another	 big	 win	 shortly	 afterward.	 Some	 European	 economic	 data	 came	 in
shockingly	bad,	so	I	bought	the	Bunds	and	made	another	£4,000.

**Oddly	enough,	all	those	trades	were	fundamental.**

I	know.	I	know.	I	think	I	am	a	slow	learner.	It	takes	me	a	long	time	to	get	things
into	my	head.	But	once	I	do	get	it,	I	get	really	good.	I	think	part	of	it	is	that
because	I	am	very	scientific,	I	want	a	lot	of	evidence.	In	an	ideal	situation,	I
would	 like	 to	 see	 ten	 examples	 of	 US	 releases	 from	 the	 Strategic	 Petroleum
Reserve.

**That’s	 probably	 another	 thing	 that	 impeded	 you	 from	 embracing
fundamentals:	 You	 don’t	 get	 a	 statistically	 significant	 number	 of
observations.**

Exactly.	I	struggled	with	that.	One	thing	that	hurt	me	is	that	I	am	too	arrogant.

**You	were	too	arrogant	in	what	way?**

I	wouldn’t	listen.

**What	would	people	tell	you	that	you	weren’t	listening	to?**

They	would	tell	me	that	I	needed	to	pay	more	attention	to	the	fundamentals.

**But	 I	 thought	 your	 bosses	 were	 telling	 you	 to	 pay	 more	 attention	 to
technicals.**

They	were	telling	me	that,	but	my	coworkers	were	telling	me	the	exact	opposite.

**You	were	getting	conflicting	advice.	By	definition,	you	could	only	listen	to
one	side.**

I	 know,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 think	 for	 myself.	 I	 should	 have	 sat	 down	 and	 thought	 it
through.	 I	 never	 did	 that.	 Most	 of	 my	 mental	 energy	 was	 spent	 on	 worrying
about	 whether	 I	 was	 good	 enough,	 and	 whether	 I	 would	 get	 fired.	 Instead,	 I
should	have	been	focusing	on	the	process.	It	took	me	a	while,	but	eventually,	I


realized	that	I	had	to	focus	more	on	the	fundamentals.

**Is	all	your	trading	now	based	solely	on	fundamentals?**

No,	ironically,	I	trade	technicals	again	after	all	these	years,	but	I	trade	them	on	a
longer	time	frame.	I	don’t	trade	technical	analysis	alone;	I	combine	it	with	the
knowledge	I	have	about	the	fundamentals.

**What	prompted	you	to	go	back	to	using	technicals?**

One	thing	about	event-driven	trading	is	that	if	there	isn’t	an	event	to	trade,	there
is	nothing	to	do,	and	it	is	really	boring.	You	can	feel	like	you’re	wasting	your
life.

**I	guess	then,	simply	out	of	boredom,	you	could	be	tempted	to	make	trades
you	really	shouldn’t	do.**

Exactly.	I	have	found	that	I	trade	much	better	when	I	have	a	side	project.	If	I
have	nothing	else	to	do	but	trade	events,	and	there	are	no	events	to	trade,	my
mind	runs	wild.	I	need	to	focus	my	attention	on	something;	otherwise,	I	will
focus	on	the	wrong	things.

A	couple	of	years	ago,	I	started	looking	into	trend-following	systems	and	testing
some	of	them.	I	wanted	to	see	for	myself	whether	trend	following	worked.	I	ran
simulations	over	many	different	parameters	and	periods.	I	played	around	with
varying	stop	sizes	and	target	levels	to	see	what	effect	those	changes	would	have.

**How	did	you	do	that	testing?**

I	wrote	programs	in	Python.

**What	kind	of	trend-following	systems	did	you	test?**

I	tested	Donchian-type	systems	and	moving	average	systems.	[Richard	Donchian
was	 a	 pioneer	 in	 trend-following	 trading.	 The	 basic	 rule	 of	 the	 system	 he
developed	was	to	buy	when	a	market	closed	at	a	new	four-week	high	and	to	sell
when	it	closed	at	a	new	four-week	low.	This	type	of	system	is	called	a	 _breakout_
system.	Basic	moving	average	systems	signal	a	buy	when	the	market	price	or	a
short-term	moving	average	rises	above	a	longer-term	moving	average,	and	they
signal	a	sell	in	the	reverse	case.]

**What	did	you	find?**

I	found	that	trend	following	does	work,	but	the	problem	is	that	you	can	incur
huge	drawdowns.

**It	worked	way	better	back	in	the	1970s	and	1980s.**

I	found	that	out	as	well.	The	results	were	much,	much	better	back	then	than	they
are	now.


**Yes,	the	trends	are	still	there,	but	the	markets	have	become	much	whippier,
making	 the	 return/risk	 performance	 of	 basic	 trend-following	 systems
marginal.	How	did	you	resolve	that	inherent	limitation	in	trend-	following
systems?**

I	don’t	use	trend	following	alone.	I	combine	it	with	my	knowledge	of	events.	So
far,	the	results	have	been	satisfactory.

**In	 doing	 your	 system	 testing,	 you	 must	 have	 found	 that	 shorter-term
breakout	 systems,	 such	 as	 Donchian’s	 four-week	 rule,	 are	 subject	 to
whipsaw	losses	and	don’t	work	very	well.**

Yes,	that’s	true.

**I	imagine	you	must	have	gone	with	a	longer-term	trend-following	system,	or
is	it	a	matter	of	something	more	complicated?**

I	 don’t	 use	 a	 computerized	 system.	 One	 of	 the	 principles	 that	 I	 had	 when	 I
started	this	research	project	was	that	I	didn’t	want	something	a	computer	could
do.	 My	 hunch	 was	 that	 if	 I	 could	 easily	 duplicate	 the	 basic	 trend-following
systems,	so	could	anyone	else.

**That	is	precisely	the	problem	with	basic	trend-following	systems—everyone
can	do	it.	In	the	1970s,	or	better	yet	the	1960s,	when	very	few	people	were
using	trend-following	systems,	they	did	very	well.	I	think	of	Ed	Seykota,
who	back	in	the	1960s	was	running	trend-following	systems	on	an	IBM	360
mainframe.	He	didn’t	have	much	competition.	But	once	you	get	to	the	stage
where	PCs	are	commonplace,	and	anyone	can	buy	trend-following	software,
the	efficacy	of	the	approach	starts	breaking	down.	So,	how	are	you	using
trend	following	to	a	positive	effect?**

Trend	 following	 by	 itself	 is	 insufficient.	 The	 critical	 elements	 are	 how	 you
manage	risk	and	how	you	take	profits	once	you	are	in	a	trade.	Initially,	I	used	to
go	for	the	home	run	when	using	trend	following.	I	would	get	in	a	trend	and	use	a
trailing	stop	to	get	out.	However,	I	found	that	when	there	was	a	large	upmove,
and	the	market	then	came	back	down	to	my	trailing	stop,	I	hated	giving	back	so
much	of	my	profits.	You	have	to	trade	your	personality.	You	have	to	feel	at	peace
with	how	you’re	trading.	After	you	get	out	of	a	trade,	whether	it	made	or	lost
money,	you	have	to	forget	about	it	like	that	[he	snaps	his	fingers].	If	you	feel
uncomfortable,	you	have	to	explore	that	feeling	because	there	is	a	reason	why
you	are	uncomfortable,	and	you	have	to	find	out	why.	That	feeling	of	discomfort
is	what	led	me	to	develop	my	methodology	for	exiting	trend	trades.

**So,	even	though	you	did	system	testing,	I	assume	you	are	not	using	technical**


**analysis	as	a	system	but	rather	as	an	input.**

The	 only	 significance	 of	 my	 trend-following	 testing	 was	 that	 it	 gave	 me
confidence	that	it	was	possible	to	make	money	off	the	charts.	But	I	don’t	trade
any	 automated	 signals;	 all	 my	 trading	 is	 discretionary.	 I	 would	 describe	 my
trading	approach	as	some	combination	of	event	interpretation,	insights	I	have
gathered	from	trend	following,	and	lessons	I	have	learned	from	the	way	Peter
Brandt	manages	risk.	[Peter	Brandt	was	interviewed	in	Chapter	1.]

**I	have	interviewed	Peter	Brandt	for	this	book.	What	specifically	did	you
learn	from	Peter?**

I	 learned	 that	 keeping	 losses	 as	 small	 as	 possible	 is	 critical	 to	 capital
preservation.	The	most	crucial	thing	in	trading	is	mental	capital.	You	need	to	be
in	 the	 right	 headspace	 for	 the	 next	 trade.	 I	 find	 that	 when	 I	 go	 into	 a	 deep
drawdown,	my	mindset	is	not	right.	I	might	start	forcing	trades	to	try	to	make
money	back.	I	might	get	gun-shy	about	taking	the	next	trade.

The	way	Peter	Brandt	manages	risk	is	incredible.	I	am	so	happy	I	studied	what
he	does.	[Bargh	showed	me	a	thick	binder	he	maintains	of	annotated	copies	of
Peter	 Brandt’s	 trades.]	 When	 Brandt	 gets	 into	 a	 trade,	 he	 expects	 it	 to	 work
straightaway	if	he	is	right.	The	best	trades	just	go.	If	there	is	any	sign	that	the
market	isn’t	doing	that,	he	tightens	his	stop	for	getting	out.	That	approach	fits	the
way	I	trade	the	fundamentals.	When	I	put	a	trade	on	in	size,	I	expect	it	to	work
immediately.	If	it	is	not	working	straightaway,	I	get	the	hell	out	of	there	fast.

**If	you	have	a	high-conviction	trade	and	put	it	on	in	size,	how	long	will	you
give	it	to	work?**

The	longer	I	am	losing	money	in	a	trade,	the	more	concerned	I	become,	and	the
more	aggressive	I	become	in	tightening	my	stop.

**Do	you	know	how	much	risk	you	are	taking	on	a	trade	when	you	put	it	on?**

I	have	a	rough	ballpark	estimate.	I	know	how	much	I	will	lose	every	time	the
market	goes	ten	ticks	against	me.

**Do	you	have	a	predetermined	number	of	ticks	you	will	give	a	trade	before
you	get	out?**

It	depends	on	the	trade.	The	more	confident	I	am,	the	more	aggressive	I	will	be
with	the	risk	I	take,	but,	equally,	the	more	aggressive	I	will	be	with	my	stop.	I
made	100%	in	one	day	on	a	Brexit	trade.	You	can	only	make	that	type	of	return
if	you’re	using	substantial	leverage	on	the	trade.	So	I	don’t	want	to	see	any	pain
in	that	type	of	trade.	If	I	see	pain,	it	is	a	massive	red	flag.


**So	when	you	put	on	a	large	trade,	you	expect	to	be	ahead	instantaneously.**

I	should	be.	Sometimes,	I	may	be	behind	for	a	split	second,	but	most	of	the	time,
if	I’m	behind	on	those	trades,	it’s	not	safe	to	stay.

**Do	you	then	get	out	right	away?**

I	do.

**Is	it	a	matter	of	minutes?**

Seconds.	Sometimes	if	it’s	not	that	large	of	a	position,	I	may	give	it	minutes.	But
if	it’s	a	significant	position,	and	it’s	not	working	in	20	or	30	seconds,	I’m	out.

People	have	difficulty	in	cutting	losses	because	they	are	afraid	of	getting	out	of
the	trade	and	then	seeing	it	go	in	their	direction.	It’s	an	ego	thing.	I	was	making
the	same	mistake	for	years.	I	would	get	into	a	trade,	put	in	my	stop,	and	see	the
position	trade	at	a	loss	for	ages	but	without	hitting	my	stop.	I	would	wait	for	my
stop	to	get	hit,	even	though	I	knew	that	90%	of	the	time,	the	trade	was	not	going
to	work.	But	I	couldn’t	bring	myself	to	get	out	because	I	couldn’t	bear	to	get	out
and	then	see	the	trade	work.	And,	sometimes,	when	I	did	get	out,	the	trade	would
then	go	to	the	target.	When	that	happens,	it	teaches	you	to	do	the	wrong	thing,
which	is	to	hold	on.	The	problem	is	that	you	only	remember	the	times	you	got
out,	and	the	trade	then	went	to	the	target;	you	don’t	remember	all	the	times	when
you	got	out,	and	it	saved	you	money.

**Why	do	you	think	that	is?**

It’s	human	nature	to	always	bias	the	negative	and	not	the	positive.	Traders	will
fail	because	they	will	just	stick	with	their	stop,	even	if	the	trade	is	not	working.
The	really	bad	traders	won’t	even	have	a	stop,	or	they	will	pull	their	stop	away
from	the	market.

**That	is	what	I	call	a	CIC	stop	order—cancel	if	close.	So	you’re	saying	that
it’s	not	enough	to	have	a	stop	on	every	trade.**

That’s	right.	Traders	will	stick	with	a	losing	trade	going	sideways	for	five	days,
and	just	wait	for	the	market	to	hit	their	stop.	To	me,	the	longer	a	trade	is	not
working,	the	more	likely	it	will	lose.

**You	mentioned	you	made	100%	on	a	Brexit	trade.	Tell	me	the	story	behind
that	trade.**

All	the	traders	in	the	office,	including	me,	were	expecting	that	the	Brexit	vote
would	not	pass,	but	we	all	came	in	around	midnight	just	on	the	off	chance	that	it
would.

**I	assume	that	if	the	Brexit	vote	had	failed,	there	would	not	have	been	any**


**trade.**

Exactly.	The	results	were	announced	region	by	region.	As	the	night	wore	on,	it
became	 increasingly	 clear	 that	 Brexit	 was	 going	 to	 win.	 The	 market	 had	 not
priced	that	in	at	all.	So	there	was	money	to	be	made.	The	obvious	trade	was	to
sell	the	British	pound.	The	problem,	however,	was	that	the	pound	was	incredibly
volatile,	and	I	was	afraid	that	if	my	timing	was	a	bit	off,	I	could	wipe	out	half	my
account.

**That	concern	is	quite	understandable.	I	remember	the	British	pound	was
flipping	around	wildly	that	night.	It	was	not	like	one	of	those	situations
where	the	news	comes	out,	and	then	the	market	moves	in	a	single	direction.**

That’s	 right.	 One	 region	 could	 have	 reported	 making	 it	 look	 like	 Brexit	 was
going	to	happen,	and	then	the	next	region	could	have	reported	and	made	it	look
like	Brexit	was	not	going	to	happen.	I	could	have	been	caught	with	my	pants
down	and	lost	a	lot	of	money.

**So	what	did	you	do	instead?**

I	bought	US	Treasurys.	I	figured	that	the	shock	of	Brexit	passing	would	cause	a
market	shift	to	risk-off	trades,	which	would	trigger	a	rally	in	US	Treasurys.	The
difference	was	that	if	I	were	wrong,	I	would	probably	lose	only	a	few	ticks	in	a
long	T-bond	position	compared	with	a	couple	of	hundred	ticks	in	a	short	British
pound	 position—a	 critical	 distinction	 given	 that	 I	 was	 putting	 on	 a	 highly
leveraged	position.

**How	much	did	T-bonds	rally?**

I	believe	it	was	something	in	the	range	of	60–100	ticks.

**Given	those	numbers,	the	long	T-bond	position	probably	offered	an	even
better	return/risk	profile	than	the	more	direct	trade	of	selling	the	British
pound.**

The	Treasurys	looked	a	lot	easier	to	trade	than	the	pound.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	a	trade	where	you	combined	your	event
trading	with	technical	analysis?**

Earlier	 this	 year	 [2019],	 gold	 wasn’t	 doing	 very	 much.	 When	 Trump	 did
something	like	impose	tariffs	on	China,	gold	was	the	least	reactive	market.	Then,
one	 weekend,	 Trump	 decided	 to	 increase	 tariffs	 on	 China.	 The	 following
Monday	 morning,	 gold	 had	 a	 strong	 upmove.	 I	 thought	 to	 myself,	 “That’s
different.”	Also,	the	price	move	coincided	with	the	breakout	I	was	looking	to
trade.	So	I	put	on	a	long	position.


**Are	you	still	in	that	position?**

No,	I	got	out.

**What	got	you	out?**

I	have	predefined	rules	about	where	to	take	profits	and	how	to	ride	trends.

**Are	these	rules	that	take	profits	because	the	trade	reaches	a	certain	level	of
profitability	or	because	the	pattern	changes	in	some	way?**

It’s	a	bit	of	both.	I’m	monitoring	the	situation	day	by	day.	I’m	looking	to	get	as
much	as	I	can	out	of	the	trend.	If	there	is	an	explosive	upmove,	I	will	tend	to
take	profits	because	any	meaningful	stop	would	risk	giving	back	too	much	of	the
open	profits.	If,	however,	the	market	has	a	steady	trend,	I	will	move	my	stop	up
gradually.	Every	situation	is	different.

**What	did	you	do	in	this	gold	trade?**

I	took	some	of	the	profits	during	the	uptrend	and	took	the	rest	when	it	started	to
pull	back.	I	always	want	to	try	to	keep	a	bit	of	the	position	when	I	am	getting	out
in	the	middle	of	an	ongoing	trend.

**Earlier,	you	talked	about	the	importance	of	having	the	right	mindset	when
trading.	Can	you	expound	on	the	mental	side	of	trading?**

My	goal	as	a	trader	is	to	always	be	in	harmony	with	my	process.	So,	I	am	using
my	feelings	as	an	input	to	trading.	I	try	to	spot	in	real-time	when	I	am	trading
poorly.	 In	 analyzing	 my	 past	 drawdowns,	 I	 found	 that	 I	 would	 start	 to	 trade
poorly	but	then	keep	on	trading	because	I	was	afraid	of	missing	the	next	trade.	I
now	have	a	straightforward	method	for	dealing	with	this	situation.	If	I	feel	like
something	is	not	right,	I	just	leave	work	early,	or	I	might	take	the	next	morning
off.	I	will	do	whatever	I	can	to	put	my	mindset	back	in	the	right	place.	I	want	to
be	 trading	 from	 a	 state	 of	 calm	 and	 inner	 peace;	 I	 don’t	 want	 any	 internal
conflict.

**So,	it’s	like	a	circuit	breaker	for	when	you	feel	your	trading	is	out	of	sync
with	the	market.**

Yes,	and	I	couldn’t	do	that	before	because	I	was	too	afraid	of	missing	a	trade.

**What	was	your	worst	trade	ever?**

My	worst	trade	was	not	my	worst	in	terms	of	loss,	but	it	was	my	worst	because
of	 the	 way	 I	 managed	 the	 trade.	 At	 the	 time,	 the	 eurozone	 PMI	 (Purchasing
Managers’	Index)	releases	were	moving	the	market	a	lot.	One	month,	either	the
German	 or	 French—I	 don’t	 remember	 which—PMI	 hugely	 beat	 market
expectations.	 I	 thought	 that	 the	 bond	 market	 would	 break	 sharply	 and	 stocks


would	 rally	 sharply.	 I	 sold	 200	 Bunds	 and	 bought	 200	 Euro	 Stoxx.	 I	 was
immediately	offside	by	about	£20,000.	I	said	to	myself,	“I	can’t	take	this	loss,”
and	I	sat	with	the	trade.	Luckily,	the	market	bounced	back,	and	I	was	able	to	get
out	with	only	a	£3,000	or	£4,000	loss.	Shortly	after	I	got	out,	the	markets	moved
violently	against	my	original	trades.	It	was	terrible.

**Actually,	the	trade	didn’t	work	out	badly,	but	if	you	didn’t	have	that	short-
lived	correction—**

I	would	have	been	cooked.

**It’s	 one	 of	 those	 situations	 where	 the	 outcome	 wasn’t	 bad—in	 fact,	 it
worked	out	much	better	than	if	you	had	immediately	taken	the	loss—but	it
could	have	been	a	disaster	if	there	hadn’t	been	that	brief	correction.	You	did
the	wrong	thing,	but	the	mistake	worked	in	your	favor.	However,	since	you
termed	it	your	“worst	trade,”	you	clearly	recognize	that	even	though	you
were	lucky,	it	was	the	wrong	decision.**

Yes,	that	trade	shook	me	up	because	it	made	me	realize	I	was	capable	of	doing
what	I	did.	It	scared	me	because	I	thought,	“I	could	do	this	again.”

**You	 drew	 the	 right	 lesson	 out	 of	 that	 experience.	 Most	 people	 would
probably	have	learned	the	exact	wrong	lesson:	“Boy,	that	was	smart	of	me
waiting	for	the	correction	instead	of	panicking	out.”	Interestingly,	what	you
label	as	your	worst	trade	was	only	a	small	loss,	and,	ironically,	the	very
thing	that	made	it	a	bad	trade	made	it	a	smaller	loss	than	it	would	otherwise
have	been.	I	think	the	ability	to	differentiate	between	the	action	and	the
outcome	is	one	of	the	reasons	you’ve	been	successful	as	a	trader.**

I’ll	never,	ever	forget	that	trade	because	I	couldn’t	believe	it.	I	never	thought	I
would	act	that	way.	Just	the	realization	that	I	was	capable	of	having	the	mentality
of,	“I	can’t	take	this	loss,”	scared	the	hell	out	of	me.	It	must	have	scared	me
enough	because	I	never	made	that	mistake	again.

**What	you	term	your	“worst	trade”	actually	didn’t	lose	much	money.	What
was	your	worst	loss	on	a	single	trade?**

In	 September	 2017,	 I	 was	 listening	 to	 the	 ECB	 press	 conference,	 and	 Mario
Draghi	made	a	statement	in	which	he	mentioned	the	strength	of	the	euro	in	the
opening	 paragraphs.	 I	 thought	 that	 comment	 was	 significant	 and	 that	 he	 was
going	 to	 devalue	 the	 euro.	 It	 was	 a	 trade	 that	 I	 had	 prepared	 for,	 and	 I
immediately	sold	200	euro	contracts.	I	had	a	profit	very	quickly,	which	is	what	I
look	for	in	these	types	of	trades.	Then	I	got	greedy	and	bought	200	Bunds.	It
wasn’t	a	trade	for	the	Bund	because	Draghi’s	comment	was	about	devaluing	the


euro,	not	about	easing	rates.

**So,	in	effect,	you	were	trying	to	pyramid	the	position	in	a	less	risky	way	by
adding	an	indirect	trade.**

Exactly.	As	soon	as	I	bought	the	Bund,	the	euro	started	coming	back,	which	was
a	big	warning	sign	for	my	original	trade.	As	I	was	getting	ready	to	bail	out	of	the
euro	position,	the	Bund	moved	sharply	against	me.	I	immediately	got	out	with	a
loss	on	both	positions,	with	most	of	the	loss	coming	from	the	impulsively	added
Bund	position.

**So,	if	you	would	have	just	stayed	with	the	originally	planned	position—**

I	would	have	had	a	small	loss.	It	was	just	greed.	The	next	day	there	was	an
event-trade	opportunity	when	the	Bank	of	England	switched	to	a	hiking	bias,	and
I	was	too	gun-shy	to	pull	the	trigger	because	I	had	just	lost	12%	the	day	before.	I
hadn’t	mentally	recovered	from	that	loss	and	couldn’t	take	the	chance	of	another
loss.	The	market	had	a	big	move,	and	the	other	traders	in	the	office	had	a	great
day,	while	I	was	sitting	there	still	reeling	from	the	day	before.	It	was	a	double
whammy	of	pain.	Then	to	make	matters	even	worse,	that	weekend,	the	traders	in
the	office	went	to	Spain	to	celebrate	Amrit’s	bachelor	party.	I	felt	like	my	world
had	just	ended,	and	I	didn’t	feel	much	like	celebrating.

**Your	weakest	performance	seems	to	have	been	in	January	through	July
2018	when	you	were	about	flat.	Nothing	horrible	about	that,	but	for	you,	it
represented	 very	 significant	 underperformance.	 Was	 there	 anything
different	about	that	period?**

I	had	a	very	good	2017	and	came	into	2018	with	the	mindset	that	I	could	push	it.
I	was	taking	too	much	risk.	I	came	back	after	a	trading	break	and	decided	to	put
my	size	back	to	where	it	was.	My	mindset	went	from,	“I	need	to	push	it,”	to	“I
need	 to	 just	 focus	 on	 keeping	 my	 capital	 together	 and	 not	 incur	 any	 more
significant	losses.”

**Did	working	with	Steve	Goldstein	help	you?	[Goldstein	is	a	London-based
trading	coach	who	worked	with	several	of	the	traders	in	this	book	and	was
my	source	in	finding	some	of	these	traders.]**

Steve	helped	me	see	a	part	of	my	personality	that	I	hadn’t	noticed.

**Which	was?**

I	tended	to	compare	myself	with	others	a	lot	and	judge	my	performance	against
them.	If	I	missed	a	big	trade,	but	no	one	else	in	the	office	traded	it,	I	didn’t	care.
But	if	one	person	traded	it,	I	hated	it	because	I	felt	he	beat	me	in	some	way.	That


feeling	is	what	kept	tripping	me	up.	I	felt	like	I	was	behind,	and	I	kept	trying	to
make	up	for	it	by	taking	too	much	size	on	the	next	trades.	That	flaw	was	a	big
part	of	the	explanation	of	why	I	did	poorly	during	the	first	half	of	2018.	Steve
helped	me	become	aware	of	what	I	was	doing.

**Weren’t	you	cognizant	of	that	before?**

I	kind	of	knew	it	but	wasn’t	fully	conscious	of	it.

**What	advice	did	Steve	give	you?**

The	strange	thing	is	he	didn’t	give	me	any	solutions.	He	pointed	out	what	I	was
doing,	though,	which	was	the	valuable	part.	He	shone	a	light	on	the	situation	and
helped	me	see	how	what	I	was	doing	was	a	problem.

**Did	the	awareness	of	how	you	responded	to	missing	a	trade	that	someone
else	caught	help	you	change	how	you	reacted?**

It	did.	My	ingrained	response	to	missing	a	trade	and	seeing	someone	else	do
better	than	me	was	just	a	bad	habit,	and	bad	habits	can	be	changed.	Once	I	was
aware	of	the	problem,	I	was	able	to	change.	For	example,	on	the	day	I	missed	the
Swiss	Bank	peg	trade	we	talked	about	earlier,	other	traders	in	the	office	had	a
great	day	because	of	that	same	trade.	In	the	past,	my	response	would	have	been,
“I	hate	them.	They	are	so	lucky.”	My	attitude	now	is	entirely	different:	“Shit	for
me,	but	good	for	them.”	I’ll	process	it	and	move	on.

**Has	your	trading	methodology	changed	over	the	years?**

Yes,	I	am	better	at	running	my	profits	now.	One	of	the	things	I	did	was	take	a
picture	of	every	trade	I	did	in	size.	I	then	went	back	and	analyzed	different	ways
of	exiting	those	trades.

**What	did	you	find?**

For	a	long	time,	I	didn’t	have	rules	for	getting	out.	It	was	more	like,	“Oh,	I’m	up
by	this	amount;	I	should	take	profits.”	I	found	that	I	could	do	better	if	I	held	on
to	a	portion	of	the	position.

**How	long	might	you	hold	that	extra	position?**

It	depends	on	how	strong	the	trend	is,	but	it	could	be	as	long	as	a	month.

**How	much	of	the	position	do	you	hold	on	to?**

I	will	keep	about	5%–10%	of	the	position.	I	still	take	a	large	majority	of	the	risk
off	 because	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 volatility	 implicit	 in	 holding	 large
positions	overnight,	let	alone	for	longer	periods.

**I	guess	even	that	small	percentage	makes	a	difference.**


It’s	 a	 nice	 feeling	 to	 add	 a	 few	 extra	 percent	 on	 a	 trade	 without	 adding	 any
significant	risk.

**What	are	the	lessons	you	learned	as	a	trader?**

```
To	be	a	good	trader,	you	have	to	have	a	high	degree	of	self-awareness.	You
have	to	be	able	to	see	your	flaws	and	strengths	and	deal	effectively	with
both—leveraging	your	strengths	and	guarding	against	your	weaknesses.
It	 doesn’t	 matter	 if	 I	 miss	 a	 trade	 because	 there	 will	 always	 be	 another
opportunity.
Mental	capital	is	the	most	critical	aspect	of	trading.	What	matters	most	is
how	 you	 respond	 when	 you	 make	 a	 mistake,	 miss	 a	 trade,	 or	 take	 a
significant	loss.	If	you	respond	poorly,	you	will	just	make	more	mistakes.
If	you	take	a	trade	that	results	in	a	loss,	but	you	didn’t	make	a	mistake,	you
have	to	be	able	to	say,	“I	would	take	that	trade	again.”
Opportunities	are	dispersed.	You	might	have	an	opportunity	today	and	then
have	to	wait	three	months	for	the	next	opportunity.	That	reality	is	hard	to
accept	 because	 you	 want	 to	 make	 a	 steady	 income	 from	 trading,	 but	 it
doesn’t	work	that	way.	In	2017,	nearly	all	my	profits	came	from	two	weeks
in	June	and	one	day	in	December.	That’s	it.	The	rest	of	the	year	amounted
to	nothing.
Have	a	long-term	focus	and	try	to	increase	your	capital	gradually	rather
than	all	at	once.
You	have	to	forgive	yourself	for	making	a	mistake.	For	a	long	time,	I	would
beat	myself	up	anytime	I	made	a	mistake,	which	only	made	things	worse.
You	have	to	accept	that	you’re	human	and	will	make	mistakes.	It	took	me
four	or	five	years	to	understand	that.	I	don’t	know	why	it	took	me	so	long.
Staring	at	these	screens	all	day	long	is	like	a	casino	inviting	you	to	click.
You	have	to	guard	against	the	temptation	of	taking	impulsive	trades.
If	a	bad	or	missed	trade	destabilizes	me,	I	have	rules	for	bouncing	back:
Take	some	time	off,	exercise,	go	out	in	nature,	have	fun.	I	used	to	have	a
habit	that	whenever	I	lost	money	in	the	markets,	I	would	spend	less	money.
I	would	tell	my	girlfriend,	“I	don’t	want	to	go	out	tonight	because	I	lost
money	today.”	That	type	of	attitude	only	causes	your	mindset	and	body	to
get	tight,	which	stops	you	from	trading	well	because	you	don’t	want	to	take
any	risk.	A	counterintuitive	concept	Amrit	taught	me	is	that	I	should	spend
```

```
more	when	I’m	losing	money.	After	I	had	a	losing	day,	he	would	say,	“Go
out	and	treat	yourself.”	The	idea	is	that	you	empower	yourself	by	still	going
out	 and	 spending	 money.	 I	 found	 that	 advice	 very	 hard	 to	 accept	 and
ignored	it	for	a	long	time.
```
**Do	you	do	that	now?**

Now,	I	am	at	a	stage	where	trading	doesn’t	affect	anything	else.

**Any	last	words?**

One	thing	that	being	depressed	made	me	conscious	of	is	the	importance	of	being
happy.	I	want	a	happy	life.	Before,	my	goal	was	to	make	a	lot	of	money.	Now
my	focus	is	on	having	a	happy	life.	Funny	enough,	I’m	still	making	money.	I’m
a	big	believer	in	focusing	on	your	happiness	first;	nothing	else	matters.

A	lesson	that	comes	up	repeatedly	in	interviewing	great	traders	is	that	you	have
to	find	a	methodology	that	fits	your	personality.	In	his	early	trading	years,	Bargh
tried	 to	 make	 technicals	 work,	 even	 though	 he	 gravitated	 more	 naturally	 to
fundamentals.	 Although	 Bargh	 was	 spending	 most	 of	 his	 time	 on	 technical
analysis,	 he	 found	 that	 virtually	 all	 of	 his	 profits	 were	 coming	 from	 his
fundamental	 trades.	 Ultimately,	 Bargh	 switched	 his	 focus	 to	 his	 preferred
methodology—fundamental	 analysis—and	 his	 trading	 improved	 dramatically.
He	later	even	found	a	way	to	incorporate	technical	analysis	effectively	by	using
it	as	an	adjunct	to	fundamental	analysis.

Bargh	believes	that	mindset	is	critical	to	successful	trading.	He	says,	“I	want	to
be	trading	from	a	state	of	calm	and	inner	peace.”	When	Bargh	finds	that	he	is
trading	poorly	and	doesn’t	have	the	right	mindset,	he	will	stop	trading	and	take	a
break.	Losses	will	beget	more	losses	if	you	continue	to	trade	when	you	are	off
balance	 because	 of	 recent	 losing	 trades.	 When	 you	 are	 out	 of	 sync	 with	 the
market,	the	best	advice	may	simply	be	to	take	a	temporary	break	from	trading
and	resume	trading	only	when	you	feel	ready	to	do	so.

In	his	earlier	years,	by	trading	a	standard	position	size	that	was	larger	than	what
he	 was	 comfortable	 with,	 fear	 of	 taking	 trades	 caused	 Bargh	 to	 miss	 many
excellent	trading	opportunities.	If	he	were	trading	a	position	size	more	in	line
with	his	comfort	zone,	he	would	have	made	and	profited	from	many	of	these
trades.	The	lesson	is	don’t	trade	so	large	that	fear	dominates	your	trading.


If	you	feel	uncomfortable	about	your	trading,	you	should	seek	to	identify	that
source	of	discomfort	and	then	modify	your	methodology	to	eliminate	it.	Bargh’s
discomfort	in	giving	back	large	open	profits	on	trend	trades	when	the	market
moved	dramatically	in	his	favor	spurred	him	to	change	his	exit	methodology	on
such	 trades.	 Instead	 of	 using	 trailing	 stops	 to	 exit	 trades,	 he	 adopted	 a	 more
price-sensitive	approach—a	modification	that	improved	his	overall	performance.

Bargh	 advises	 guarding	 against	 the	 temptation	 of	 taking	 impulsive	 trades.
Impulsive	 trades	 are	 often	 triggered	 by	 impatience—an	 urge	 to	 do	 something
while	 you	 are	 waiting	 for	 a	 trade	 that	 legitimately	 meets	 your	 criteria.	 The
market	rewards	patience	and	trades	borne	of	impatience	are	usually	detrimental.

Trading	to	earn	a	consistent	amount	steadily	may	be	an	admirable	goal,	but	it	is
not	 a	 realistic	 one.	 Market	 opportunities	 are	 sporadic.	 Sometimes,	 the	 market
will	provide	great	opportunities;	other	times,	months	will	pass	without	a	good
trading	opportunity.	Bargh	mentioned	that	in	one	very	successful	year,	virtually
all	of	his	profits	came	from	a	two-week	period	and	one	other	day.	If	you	try	to
force	consistent	profitability,	you	will	be	prone	to	take	suboptimal	trades,	which
will	often	end	up	reducing	your	overall	profitability.

If	a	trade	is	not	acting	as	expected,	cut	losses	immediately.	Bargh	will	get	out	in
seconds	 if	 a	 big	 trade	 is	 not	 working	 as	 anticipated.	 Such	 instantaneous	 risk
cutting	will	not	apply	to	most	traders,	but	the	idea	of	cutting	risk	quickly	relative
to	the	methodology	used	is	still	critical	advice.

Using	 stops	 on	 every	 trade	 is	 one	 way	 to	 control	 losses.	 But	 if	 a	 trade	 isn’t
showing	a	profit	in	a	reasonable	period	(the	definition	of	“reasonable”	will	be
dependent	on	the	specific	methodology),	Bargh	insists	there	is	no	reason	to	wait
for	the	stop	to	be	hit.	He	believes	that	the	reduced	losses	that	can	be	achieved	by
not	 waiting	 for	 a	 stop	 to	 be	 hit	 will	 outweigh	 the	 gains	 from	 trades	 that	 are
negative	for	the	initial	period	and	then	recover	without	the	stop	being	hit.

You	don’t	have	to	exit	a	profitable	trade	all	at	once.	Even	if	a	trade	reaches	your
target,	it	may	make	sense	to	keep	a	small	portion	of	the	position,	so	you	get
some	additional	profit	if	the	market	keeps	moving	in	the	direction	of	the	original
trade.	 Bargh	 will	 routinely	 maintain	 5%–10%	 of	 a	 position	 that	 he	 liquidates
because	 it	 has	 met	 his	 target.	 He	 finds	 that	 maintaining	 such	 small	 partial
positions	increases	his	overall	profits	without	meaningfully	increasing	his	risk.

Missed	trades	can	be	more	painful—and	more	expensive—than	trading	losses.
Bargh	missed	a	major	trade	opportunity	by,	atypically,	leaving	the	office	to	take
care	of	a	bank	errand.	Over	the	long-term,	trading	success	depends	not	only	on


trades	made	but	also	on	minimizing	missed	trade	opportunities.

The	obvious	way	to	execute	a	trade	idea	may	not	always	be	the	best	approach.
Sometimes,	a	related	market	can	provide	a	better	return/risk	trade.	For	example,
when	the	evolving	voting	returns	increasingly	pointed	to	a	surprise	win	for	the
Brexit	referendum,	the	straightforward	trade	would	have	been	to	sell	the	British
pound.	However,	the	problem	was	that	the	British	pound	was	swinging	wildly	as
the	 voting	 returns	 were	 coming	 in,	 meaning	 that	 a	 short	 British	 pound	 trade
could	easily	get	stopped	out,	even	if	the	trade	ultimately	proved	correct.	Bargh
surmised	that	another	consequence	of	a	surprise	win	for	the	Brexit	referendum
would	be	a	market	shift	favoring	risk-off	positions.	So,	instead	of	selling	the
British	 pound,	 Bargh	 bought	 US	 Treasurys,	 which	 were	 far	 less	 volatile	 and
could	be	traded	with	meaningful	stops	that	required	much	less	risk.	In	effect,
long	T-bonds	(the	indirect	trade)	provided	much	better	return/risk	than	the	direct
and	obvious	trade	of	selling	the	British	pound.	The	lesson	is	that	the	way	a	trade
idea	is	implemented	can	be	more	important	than	the	trade	idea	itself.

Bargh’s	 worst	 loss	 occurred	 when	 he	 tried	 to	 double	 his	 market	 exposure	 by
adding	 a	 large	 position	 in	 a	 related	 market—a	 position	 that	 didn’t	 share	 a
justification	for	the	trade,	as	did	the	original	position.	It	was	an	action	that	Bargh
readily	 admits	 was	 motivated	 by	 greed.	 The	 unplanned	 position	 resulted	 in
turning	what	would	have	been	an	acceptable	small	loss	into	a	large	loss,	with
most	of	the	loss	coming	from	the	added	trade	that	lacked	the	criteria	for	being
implemented	in	the	first	place.	Trades	motivated	by	greed	usually	end	badly.

The	 day	 after	 this	 worst	 loss,	 which	 was	 a	 direct	 consequence	 of	 a	 trading
mistake,	a	change	in	Bank	of	England	monetary	policy	provided	the	exact	type
of	event-trading	opportunity	Bargh	seeks	out.	The	trade	worked	spectacularly
well,	except	that	Bargh	didn’t	take	it.	He	was	still	destabilized	from	the	previous
day’s	costly	trade	error	and	couldn’t	bring	himself	to	take	on	any	new	risk.	This
experience	illustrates	an	important	trading	lesson:	The	damage	from	a	bad	trade
often	extends	well	beyond	the	loss	on	the	trade	itself.	By	shaking	up	a	trader’s
confidence,	 such	 trades	 can	 lead	 to	 missing	 winning	 trades	 the	 trader	 would
otherwise	have	taken.	The	resulting	missed	profits	can	often	even	exceed	the
loss	on	the	original	trade.

Traders	 need	 to	 distinguish	 between	 trade	 outcomes	 and	 trade	 decisions.
Sometimes,	a	good	decision	may	have	a	poor	outcome,	and	a	poor	decision	may
have	a	beneficial	outcome.	The	trade	Bargh	labels	as	his	“worst	trade”	was	one
in	which	he	couldn’t	bring	himself	to	take	a	large	loss	and	just	held	on	to	the


position.	The	trade	temporarily	recovered,	and	Bargh	liquidated	it.	Soon	after,
the	market	moved	violently	against	his	original	position.	By	hesitating	instead	of
acting	 to	 cut	 his	 loss	 quickly,	 Bargh	 turned	 a	 large	 loss	 into	 a	 smaller	 loss.
Although	the	outcome	of	this	decision	was	favorable,	Bargh	recognized	that	he
was	just	lucky	and	that	if	a	short-lived	recovery	hadn’t	occurred,	his	original
large	loss	could	have	turned	into	a	disastrous	one.	Bargh	realized	he	had	made	an
immense	trading	mistake,	even	though	that	mistake	turned	out	to	be	beneficial.

Many	 traders	 erroneously	 evaluate	 their	 trading	 based	 solely	 on	 outcomes,
whereas	 meaningful	 evaluation	 should	 be	 based	 on	 whether	 trading	 decisions
were	consistent	with	their	methodology	and	risk	control	rules.	Winning	trades
(or	smaller	losing	trades,	as	was	the	case	in	this	example)	can	be	bad	trades	if
they	 violate	 trading	 and	 risk	 control	 rules	 that	 have	 been	 responsible	 for	 a
trader’s	longer-term	success.	Similarly,	losing	trades	can	be	good	trades	if	the
trader	followed	a	process	that	has	demonstrated	efficacy	in	generating	profits
with	acceptable	risk.

# Amrit	Sall: 	The	Unicorn	Sniper

# AMRIT	Sall	has	one	of	the	best	track	records	I	have	ever	encountered.	Over	a	13-

year	career,	Sall	has	achieved	an	average	annual	compounded	return	of	337%
(yes,	that’s	annual,	not	cumulative).	And	return	is	not	even	the	most	impressive
aspect	 of	 his	 performance.	 His	 return/risk	 numbers	 are	 nothing	 short	 of
astounding:	an	adjusted	Sortino	ratio	of	17.6,	monthly	Gain	to	Pain	ratio	of	21.1,
and	a	daily	Gain	to	Pain	ratio	of	3.6.	These	numbers	are	10	times	the	levels	of
what	 could	 be	 considered	 excellent	 performance	 (see	 Appendix	 2	 for	 the
definitions	and	context	of	these	statistics).

Sall	also	provides	a	perfect	example	of	the	deficiency	of	the	Sharpe	ratio.	His
Sharpe	ratio	is	1.43,	an	excellent	level,	but	not	a	particularly	exceptional	one.
The	 Sharpe	 ratio’s	 primary	 pitfall	 is	 that	 its	 risk	 component	 (the	 standard
deviation)	penalizes	large	gains	equivalently	to	large	losses.	For	a	trader	like
Sall,	 who	 has	 many	 spectacularly	 large	 gains,	 this	 penalty	 is	 severe.	 Sall’s

_adjusted_^13 	Sortino	ratio,	a	statistic	that	only	penalizes	downside	volatility,	is	12
times	as	large	as	his	Sharpe	ratio.	This	extreme	imbalance	between	the	two	ratios
is	 extraordinary.	 Most	 traders	 have	 an	 adjusted	 Sortino	 ratio	 to	 Sharpe	 ratio
closer	to	1:1.	Even	traders	with	excellent	return	to	risk	have	adjusted	Sortino	to
Sharpe	ratios	closer	to	2:1	or	3:1.	A	ratio	of	12:1	indicates	that	Sall’s	large	gains
are	tremendously	greater	and	far	more	prevalent	than	his	large	losses.	You	can
see	the	stark	asymmetry	between	gains	and	losses	in	Sall’s	daily	returns:	He	had
34	days	with	returns	greater	than	15%	(three	of	them	with	returns	greater	than
100%—yes,	that	is	not	a	typo)	and	only	one	day	with	a	double-digit	loss.	And
even	that	one	double-digit	loss	(discussed	in	the	interview)	was	primarily	due	to
circumstances	beyond	his	control.

Sall	is	a	senior	member	of	a	group	of	traders	who	trade	independently	but	share
information	 and	 opinions.	 His	 colleagues	 hold	 Sall	 in	 high	 esteem.	 Richard
Bargh	(see	Chapter	3)	says,	“Amrit	has	an	amazing	mindset.	He	is	very	mentally
strong	and	always	has	an	optimistic	outlook.	He	really	knows	where	his	edge	is
and	knows	when	to	push	it	and	when	not	to.	So	he	keeps	his	losses	very	small.
He	has	no	apparent	weaknesses	as	a	trader.”	Another	colleague	describes	Sall’s
trade	execution	as	“a	thing	of	beauty.”

Sall	has	a	unique	trading	style—one	that	I	have	not	come	across	among	any	of
the	traders	I	interviewed	in	previous	 _Market	Wizards_ books.	 Although	 in	 this


book	 there	 is	 another	 trader	 with	 a	 similar	 trading	 style	 (Richard	 Bargh),	 a
resemblance	that	is	related	to	Sall	being	a	mentor	to	Bargh	in	his	early	trading
career.	Sall	focuses	on	trading	market-moving	events,	seeking	to	capture	large
gains	over	short	time	intervals—typically	only	minutes—by	identifying	events
that	 signal	 a	 high	 probability	 of	 accelerated	 price	 swings	 in	 the	 anticipated
direction.	He	implements	this	core	strategy	in	large-sized	positions	because	his
preparation	 for	 these	 trades	 gives	 him	 high	 confidence	 about	 the	 short-term
market	direction	implied	by	different	event	scenarios.

Sall	is	meticulous	in	keeping	comprehensive	write-ups	on	every	trade	he	has
ever	taken	and	the	significant	trades	he	has	missed.	He	groups	these	trade	logs
by	 category,	 filling	 multiple	 binders	 with	 trade	 descriptions.	 These	 write-ups
provide	analogue	models	that	aid	Sall	in	determining	whether	a	prospective	trade
is	more	likely	to	be	a	major	opportunity	or	subpar.	The	knowledge	base	provided
by	his	compilation	of	past	trade	summaries	also	allows	Sall	to	create	a	trading
plan	 for	 both	 the	 execution	 and	 management	 of	 an	 anticipated	 trade.	 After	 a
trade	is	made,	Sall	will	summarize	what	he	did	and	what	he	got	wrong	and	right.
At	the	end	of	each	month,	Sall	reviews	the	trade	summaries	for	the	prior	month.
Before	any	significant	expected	trade,	he	will	review	similar	past	trade	write-ups
as	analogues	for	how	the	market	might	be	expected	to	react.

Once	he	has	done	all	his	research,	Sall	will	do	mental	rehearsal	in	preparation
for	 a	 trade,	 so	 that	 he	 can	 respond	 unhesitatingly	 whatever	 the	 details	 of	 an
anticipated	 event	 prove	 to	 be.	 As	 he	 describes	 it,	 “I	 will	 spend	 some	 time
visualizing	and	internalizing	how	the	trade	might	play	out.	This	mental	rehearsal
allows	me	to	act	instantaneously.	It	includes	not	only	triggers	for	getting	into	the
trade	 but	 also	 a	 plan	 for	 managing	 the	 trade.	 I	 will	 also	 envision	 different
scenarios	where	the	trade	goes	horribly	wrong	or	where	it	goes	very	well	and
know	how	I	will	react	in	each	case.”

I	interviewed	Sall	on	a	Sunday,	the	day	after	my	interview	with	Richard	Bargh,
in	the	same	conference	room	adjacent	to	their	trading	floor.	Apparently,	Bargh
must	have	warned	Sall	that	I	guzzled	sparkling	water,	as	he	had	several	large
bottles	on	hand.	The	interview	lasted	the	full	day.	After	we	finished,	Sall	took
me	 to	 dinner	 at	 what	 could	 best	 be	 described	 as	 an	 Indian	 fusion	 restaurant.
Since	 I	 eat	 virtually	 everything,	 I	 let	 Sall,	 who	 is	 Indian,	 do	 the	 ordering.	 I
hesitated	about	one	of	his	choices—barbecued	chicken	wings—because	I	hate
sweet	foods.	I	needn’t	have	worried;	apparently,	Indian	barbecue	has	nothing	to
do	with	American	barbecue.	Although	we	had	spent	the	entire	day	talking,	it	was
relaxing	 to	 have	 a	 conversation	 that	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 trading,	 while


enjoying	a	delicious	meal.

**Did	you	have	any	career	aspirations	in	your	childhood	or	teen	years?**

Not	at	all.	I	was	all	over	the	place.	I	didn’t	even	have	any	idea	what	I	wanted	to
study	 at	 the	 university	 level.	 I	 stumbled	 into	 economics.	 My	 grades	 weren’t
exactly	great	in	college,	which	is	hardly	surprising	since	I	never	even	looked	at	a
textbook.	At	that	point,	I	wasn’t	motivated	by	academia.	I	was	more	interested	in
playing	 soccer	 with	 my	 friends.	 My	 first	 choice	 was	 to	 pursue	 a	 degree	 in
business	information	systems	because	it	was	what	my	friends	were	doing,	but
that	is	a	popular	course,	and	my	grades	weren’t	good	enough	to	be	accepted	into
the	program.	However,	I	was	able	to	get	into	the	economics	program.	Ironically,
looking	back	at	it	now,	what	I	thought	was	a	failure	in	my	life	at	that	time—not
getting	better	grades	in	school—was	exactly	what	needed	to	happen	to	facilitate
my	becoming	a	trader.

**That’s	one	thing	about	life:	You	never	know	what	is	good	and	what	is	bad.
Sometimes	things	that	seem	bad	end	up	being	fortunate	and	vice	versa.	How
did	you	go	from	earning	an	economics	degree	to	becoming	a	trader?**

I	 enrolled	 in	 a	 master’s	 program	 in	 investment	 banking	 and	 international
securities	 at	 the	 University	 of	 Reading,	 and	 I	 put	 my	 all	 into	 it.	 They	 had	 a
simulated	trading	room,	which	was	my	first	exposure	to	markets	and	trading,	and
I	 fell	 in	 love	 with	 it.	 While	 I	 was	 at	 Reading,	 there	 was	 a	 presentation	 by	 a
couple	 of	 guys	 who	 were	 ex-LIFFE	 floor	 traders	 from	 Refco.	 After	 the
presentation,	I	shoved	a	pen	and	pad	at	them	and	said,	“Tell	me	everything	I
need	 to	 know.	 What	 books	 and	 articles	 should	 I	 read?	 What	 blogs	 should	 I
follow?	 I’m	 interested	 in	 everything	 and	 anything	 about	 the	 practical	 side	 of
trading.”	One	of	them	gave	me	his	card	and	said,	“Call	me	on	Monday.”	I	was
accepted	into	a	trader	training	program	before	I	graduated.

**Tell	me	about	the	training	program.**

Initially,	 it	 was	 full-time	 classroom	 instruction.	 The	 firm	 taught	 us	 about
technical	analysis,	fundamental	analysis,	and	the	psychology	of	trading.	After
about	two	months	of	instruction,	they	transitioned	us	to	trading	on	a	simulator.

**How	many	people	were	in	your	training	program?**

About	20.

**How	many	ultimately	survived?**


Two.

**That’s	 about	 what	 I	 would	 have	 guessed.	 Initially,	 did	 you	 feel	 more
comfortable	trading	on	technical	analysis	or	fundamentals?**

Neither.	For	the	first	year,	I	didn’t	feel	comfortable	with	anything.	I	was	trying
everything,	and	that	is	what	you	should	do.

**What	methodology	did	you	use	when	you	first	started	trading?**

I	tried	trading	breakouts	from	trendlines	and	intraday	consolidations,	looking	for
a	quick	buck.

**How	did	that	work	out?**

I	made	money	initially,	but	over	the	longer	term,	it	was	a	net	negative	strategy.	It
is	an	approach	that	feeds	into	your	impulsive	nature.	You’re	trying	to	make	easy
money.	Eventually,	you	realize	that	is	not	how	it’s	going	to	work.

**I	actually	find	trendline	breakouts	to	be	one	of	the	most	unreliable	signals.
What	trips	people	up	is	that	when	you	look	at	a	chart,	it	seems	like	trendline
breakouts	work.	But	that	perception	is	a	consequence	of	knowing	where	to
draw	the	trendline	with	the	benefit	of	hindsight.	What	most	people	don’t
realize	is	that,	in	real-time,	there	were	often	multiple	other	trendlines	that
experienced	what	proved	to	be	false	breakouts,	which,	effectively,	redefined
the	 trendline.	 What	 did	 you	 gravitate	 to	 after	 you	 gave	 up	 on	 trading
trendline	breakouts?**

I	tried	several	other	technical	approaches,	none	of	which	appealed	to	me.	I	don’t
like	putting	on	a	trade	where	as	soon	as	I	put	it	on,	I	feel	that	I	have	to	be	lucky
for	it	to	work,	and	technical-based	trades	made	me	feel	like	that.

**Since	you	really	didn’t	have	any	methodology	at	the	time,	what	was	your
experience	when	you	first	started	trading	real	money?**

I	was	profitable	straight	off	the	bat.

**Since	your	forays	into	using	various	technical	signals	didn’t	pan	out,	how
were	you	making	money?**

I	 was	 trading	 fundamental	 events	 a	 lot.	 I	 saw	 the	 potential	 in	 the	 volatility
around	these	events,	and	I	wasn’t	shy.	I	would	jump	in	headfirst	when	I	thought
something	was	a	trade,	whereas	I	think	most	junior	traders	tend	to	hesitate	when
they	see	a	lot	of	volatility.	They	will	prefer	less	volatile	trades	like	buying	or
selling	on	breakouts.

**So	you	were	attracted	to	the	volatility.**

I	was	attracted	to	the	volatility,	and	I	was	aggressive	with	it.


**Back	then,	when	there	was	a	significant	headline,	how	did	you	trade	it?**

If	it	was	a	surprise	that	the	market	wasn’t	pricing	in,	I	would	get	in	as	quickly	as
I	could	and	with	as	much	size	as	I	could,	anticipating	that	the	market	would	have
to	adjust	to	the	new	information.	Over	time,	the	opportunities	to	do	these	types
of	trades	diminished,	and	it	became	necessary	to	rely	more	on	trades	where	the
expected	outcome	in	response	to	the	news	flow	was	not	black	and	white.

**Were	 these	 expected	 headlines,	 such	 as	 scheduled	 economic	 reports	 or
announcements,	or	unexpected	headlines?**

Both.

**For	the	latter,	I	assume	you	had	to	be	watching	the	newsfeed	continuously
throughout	the	trading	day.	Moreover,	I	assume	you	had	to	be	so	informed
on	the	fundamentals	driving	a	given	market	that	you	could	instantaneously
assess	the	price	implications	of	any	news	item.**

Yes.	There	are	only	a	handful	of	factors	driving	any	particular	market	at	any
given	time.	It	is	a	matter	of	being	aware	of	what	is	relevant	to	a	market	and	what
is	priced	in.	If	a	key	central	banker	came	out	and	said	something	contrary	to
what	was	priced	in,	that	would	be	a	big	trigger.	I	would	react	without	hesitation
and	place	an	aggressive	trade.

**How	long	would	you	hold	the	trade?**

I	would	hold	it	anywhere	from	minutes	to	hours.

**How	large	was	the	account	they	gave	you	to	trade?**

There	 wasn’t	 actually	 a	 specific	 amount	 of	 money	 you	 were	 given	 to	 trade.
Instead,	you	were	given	a	risk	line	of	£30,000.

**So,	if	you	lost	that	amount,	you	would	be	shown	the	door.**

That	was	what	we	were	told.

**You	said	that	you	were	immediately	profitable.	How	much	did	you	make
that	first	year?**

By	midyear,	I	had	made	about	£150,000.	At	that	point,	I	took	out	£50,000,	and
the	company	took	out	the	same	amount.	We	had	a	50/50	split	arrangement,	and
whenever	you	withdrew	profits,	the	company	withdrew	an	equal	amount.

**So,	after	the	withdrawal,	your	trading	account	was	back	to	£50,000.	What
happened	during	the	second	half	of	your	first	year	of	trading?**

I	managed	to	blow	the	entire	£50,000	and	went	into	a	negative	balance.

**Did	 something	 change	 that	 explains	 the	 drastic	 reversal	 in	 your**


**performance	during	the	second	six	months	of	your	trading	versus	the	first
six	months?**

I	think	in	the	first	six	months,	I	hadn’t	been	challenged	by	tough	markets.

**In	the	first	six	months	of	trading	when	you	are	doing	so	well,	did	you	get
cocky?**

Oh	yeah.	I	was	straight	out	of	school,	and	I	thought,	“This	is	great.	This	is	so
easy.”	That’s	why	when	I	was	served	humble	pie	by	the	market,	it	was	a	real
wake-up	call.

**Since	 your	 account	 had	 gone	 negative	 and	 there	 was	 a	 cutoff	 point	 at
£30,000,	were	you	concerned	that	you	might	be	knocked	out	of	the	game?**

That	was	always	a	fear	in	my	mind.	Even	though	I	didn’t	want	to	exit,	I	knew	I
could	still	be	pushed	out.	I	remember	feeling	quite	miserable	at	the	time.	Trading
was	all	I	really	wanted	to	do.	I	had	no	backup	plan.	It’s	like	the	old	saying,	“If
you	want	to	take	the	island,	burn	the	boats.”	I	was	all	in.	I	had	no	plan	B.	I	had
no	aspirations	to	do	anything	else	other	than	trade.	There	was	no	way	I	was
going	to	fail.

**Did	being	so	close	to	a	knockout	point	make	you	more	cautious	in	your
trading?**

You	have	to	become	cautious	in	some	sense.	When	your	drawdown	reaches	a
certain	level,	you	have	to	cut	your	size.	That	said,	I’m	in	the	game	of	catching
unicorns.	They’re	not	on	every	corner.	When	a	unicorn	turns	up—a	trade	where
everything	lines	up	exactly	the	way	I	want	it—I	have	to	go	for	it	aggressively,
even	when	I	am	in	a	drawdown.	I	am	only	going	to	get	about	10	of	those	trades	a
year,	and	I	can’t	afford	to	pass	up	one	of	those	opportunities.	That	perspective
puts	me	in	a	position	where	I	am	never	more	than	one	or	two	trades	away	from
getting	out	of	a	drawdown.

**Were	you	doing	anything	wrong	during	the	second	half	of	the	year?	Were
you	losing	money	because	you	were	making	trading	mistakes	or	because	the
market	was	just	unfavorable	for	your	strategy,	even	though	you	were	still
following	your	methodology?**

I	got	cocky	and	relaxed	with	my	discipline.	I	loosened	my	entry	criteria	by	not
sticking	to	my	type	of	trades.	It	was	the	classic	mistake	of	doing	well	and	then
loosening	 up.	 Back	 then,	 I	 was	 vulnerable	 to	 experiencing	 drawdowns	 after
periods	when	I	had	done	particularly	well.	Fortunately,	I	have	transcended	that
pattern.


**Did	the	losses	come	primarily	from	taking	trades	that	were	deer	instead	of
unicorns,	or	did	they	come	from	unicorn	trades	that	didn’t	work?**

It	was	definitely	the	former.	It	was	a	matter	of	being	impatient	and	trying	to
force	trades.	I	was	trying	to	make	money	out	of	nothing.	I	remember	one	time
during	that	drawdown	period,	in	response	to	an	ECB	[European	Central	Bank]
announcement,	I	put	on	my	risk-limit	positions	in	the	Bund,	Bobl,	and	Schatz
[10-year,	 five-year,	 and	 two-year	 German	 interest	 rate	 contracts].	 The	 risk
manager	came	over,	crouched	down	at	the	side	of	my	desk,	and	said,	“Amrit,
what	are	you	doing?	What	are	you	going	to	do	with	these	positions?”	I	froze
momentarily,	and	then	I	snapped	out	of	it.	That	was	the	first	time	I	realized	how
dangerous	it	could	be	to	become	lax	in	my	trading.

**You	had	your	maximum	allowable	position	in	three	extremely	correlated
contracts.	Effectively,	you	had	a	triple	position.	What	was	the	catalyst	for
taking	such	an	aggressive	approach?**

It	was	a	comment	that	I	can’t	even	remember	now,	but	I	know	that	it	was	a
marginal	comment.	I	was	in	a	significant	drawdown,	and	I	was	hoping	I	could
come	back.

**So,	you	not	only	put	on	a	marginal	trade	that	was	questionable,	but	you	did
it	in	triple	size.	What	did	you	do	after	the	risk	manager	came	over	to	your
desk	and	made	that	comment?**

I	realized	that	I	was	in	a	position,	 _hoping	_ for	it	to	work.	The	second	I	realized
that	I	was	hoping	and	not	trading	anymore,	I	immediately	liquidated	everything.
That	lesson	has	stuck	with	me	to	this	day.	I	never	want	a	position	where	I	am
hoping	 that	 it	 will	 work.	 I	 had	 to	 go	 through	 that	 experience	 to	 know	 the
difference	between	a	trade	where	I	have	full	conviction	and	a	trade	where	I	am
hoping.

**The	obvious	lesson	from	that	experience	was	beware	of	trades	borne	of	hope
rather	than	conviction.	Were	there	any	other	lessons?**

I	learned	the	importance	of	being	patient.	Market	opportunities	are	always	going
to	be	there.	With	the	benefit	of	hindsight	and	experience,	I	can	now	say	that	the
big	trades	are	pretty	simple.	You	don’t	have	to	go	looking	for	them,	but	you	do
have	to	wait	for	them.	Trading	opportunities	in	the	market	ebb	and	flow.	There
will	 be	 periods	 in	 the	 markets	 where	 opportunities	 dry	 up,	 and	 there	 will	 be
nothing	to	do.	In	those	nothing	periods,	if	you	are	looking	for	something	to	do,
that	is	when	you	can	create	real	damage	to	your	account.	That	is	what	I	was
doing;	I	was	still	trying	to	do	something	when	nothing	was	happening.	Instead,	I


should	have	been	waiting	for	opportunities.	It’s	the	same	idea	expressed	by	Jim
Rogers	in	one	of	your	books	when	he	said,	“I	just	wait	until	there	is	money	lying
in	the	corner,	and	all	I	have	to	do	is	go	over	there	and	pick	it	up.	I	do	nothing	in
the	meantime.”

**I	like	to	cite	Debussy’s	quote	that	“Music	is	the	space	between	the	notes,”
because	 an	 analogous	 statement	 about	 trading—Trading	 is	 the	 space
between	trades—is	so	strikingly	apropos.**

I	firmly	believe	that	is	true.	To	facilitate	the	outstanding	trades,	you	need	to	be
doing	nothing	in	between.	I	always	ask	myself:	Am	I	in	a	state	of	readiness?	Am
I	fully	prepared?	Am	I	wasting	my	financial	capital	and	mental	capital	on	subpar
trades	instead	of	waiting	patiently	for	the	real	trade	opportunities?

**Ironically,	implicit	in	your	statement	that	the	big	trades	are	simple	is	the
idea	that	it’s	the	** **_not_** **	trading	that’s	difficult,	whereas	making	good	trades	is
easy.**

I	completely	agree.	Any	idiot	can	make	something	complicated.	When	I	look
back	at	the	trades	responsible	for	my	best	return	months,	they	just	scream	out	to
me,	 _This	is	a	big	trade	opportunity_ .	Had	I	taken	only	those	trades	and	none	of
the	others,	my	returns	would	probably	have	been	double	what	they	were.	But
trading	doesn’t	work	that	way.	You	have	to	learn	to	not	be	impulsive	and	to	not
do	silly	things	in	the	interim	periods—“the	space	between	the	notes,”	as	you
term	it.	One	of	the	mistakes	I	made	in	those	early	years	was	that	when	nothing
was	 going	 on,	 I	 forced	 marginal	 trades,	 wasting	 mental	 and	 financial	 capital,
instead	of	waiting	for	the	unicorn	that	would	eventually	show	up.	Learning	from
that	mistake	was	one	of	the	pivotal	lessons	in	my	trading	career.	I	now	know	that
90%	of	the	time,	the	market	is	not	going	to	provide	any	opportunities,	and	10%
of	the	time,	I	will	make	90%	of	my	profits.

**Now	 we	 are	 sitting	 here	 with	 the	 comfort	 of	 knowing	 your	 subsequent
history.	 But,	 back	 in	 your	 first	 trading	 year,	 when	 your	 account	 went
negative,	you	wouldn’t	have	known	that	you	would	eventually	succeed.	You
had	 some	 early	 success	 followed	 by	 failure,	 and	 you	 were	 in	 danger	 of
getting	 knocked	 out	 of	 the	 game.	 Where	 was	 your	 mental	 state	 at	 that
point?**

It’s	an	odd	thing	to	say,	but	I	knew	I	would	succeed.	I	knew	it	was	going	to	work
out.	I	just	had	to	stay	in	the	game.

**So,	even	back	then,	with	your	account	underwater,	you	were	still	confident.**

Yes,	because	I	had	a	taste	of	what	it	was	like	to	have	good	trades	on,	and	I	knew


there	were	going	to	be	more	of	them.	I	just	had	to	stay	in	the	game	long	enough
for	my	stars	to	be	aligned	again.

**We	are	talking	about	the	lessons	you	learned	during	the	second	half	of	your
first	year	of	trading.	Did	those	lessons	register	then,	or	are	they	insights	you
realized	later	and	are	referencing	now	in	retrospect?**

I	realized	even	then	that	I	couldn’t	carry	on	doing	what	I	was	doing.	I	knew	I
was	close	to	the	exit	door,	and	I	couldn’t	afford	to	take	any	marginal	trades.	I
stopped	 trading	 technicals.	 I	 didn’t	 make	 any	 trades	 unless	 I	 had	 a	 lot	 of
conviction.

_To	 follow	 the	 ensuing	 dialogue,	 readers	 need	 to	 understand	 the	 term
“quantitative	easing.”	The	following	is	a	short	primer	intended	for	readers	who
may	not	fully	comprehend	this	term._

Typically,	the	Fed	seeks	to	adjust	interest	rates	by	targeting	the	Fed	funds	rate,
which	is	the	overnight	rate	at	which	banks	lend	money	to	each	other.	The	Fed’s
primary	tool	for	targeting	the	Fed	funds	rate	is	termed	 _open	market	operations_ —
the	 buying	 and	 selling	 of	 short-term	 Treasurys	 to	 increase	 or	 decrease	 the
quantity	of	money	and,	in	turn,	reduce	or	raise	interest	rates.	For	example,	if	the
Fed	wanted	to	reduce	the	Fed	funds	rate,	it	would	“print”	(electronically	create)
money	to	buy	short-term	Treasurys,	increasing	the	price	of	Treasurys,	which	is
equivalent	to	reducing	interest	rates.

In	a	sense,	quantitative	easing	is	an	extension	of	normal	open	market	operations.
When	 short-term	 interest	 rates	 fall	 to	 near	 zero,	 the	 standard	 tool	 of	 buying
short-term	 Treasurys	 to	 provide	 economic	 stimulus	 no	 longer	 works	 because
short-term	interest	rates	are	already	near	zero.	This	situation	was	the	dilemma
the	 Fed	 faced	 during	 the	 financial	 crisis	 in	 2008	 and	 its	 aftermath.	 The	 Fed
responded	 with	 quantitative	 easing,	 which	 meant	 increasing	 the	 supply	 of
money,	 as	 in	 normal	 open	 market	 operations,	 but	 without	 the	 objective	 of
decreasing	short-term	interest	rates,	which	were	already	near	zero.	In	practical
terms,	 quantitative	 easing	 meant	 the	 Fed	 created	 money	 to	 purchase	 non-
traditional	assets	(i.e.,	assets	other	than	short-term	Treasurys).	Specifically,	the
Fed	 bought	 longer-term	 Treasurys	 and	 non-government	 assets,	 such	 as
mortgage-backed	 securities.	 By	 purchasing	 longer-term	 Treasurys,	 the	 Fed
reduced	longer-term	interest	rates—an	action	that	could	still	provide	economic


stimulus.	 The	 Fed’s	 motivation	 for	 buying	 other	 types	 of	 assets,	 such	 as
mortgage-backed	securities,	was	to	mitigate	the	meltdown	in	these	other	sectors
during	the	financial	panic.

The	Fed’s	first	quantitative	easing	move	occurred	in	November	2008	when,	to
support	 the	 mortgage	 and	 housing	 market,	 it	 purchased	 mortgage-related
government	 agency	 assets	 and	 private	 mortgage-backed	 securities,	 a	 financial
asset	class	for	which	buyer	demand	had	virtually	disappeared.	At	that	point,	the
Fed	 had	 still	 not	 applied	 quantitative	 easing	 to	 the	 purchase	 of	 longer-term
Treasurys,	although	there	was	speculation	that	it	would	at	some	point.

**Your	trading	history	contains	many	days	with	exceptional	gains.	I	counted
34	days	in	which	you	made	a	return	above	15%,	15	days	with	returns	above
25%,	and	five	days	with	returns	above	50%.	But	even	with	this	history	of
days	with	huge	gains,	one	day	stands	out:	March	18,	2009,	when	your	return
exceeded	an	unbelievable	800%!	How	was	that	even	possible?	What	is	the
story	behind	that	trade?**

In	 November	 2008,	 when	 the	 Fed	 first	 announced	 quantitative	 easing,	 it
purchased	 mortgage-backed	 securities	 to	 stabilize	 the	 markets	 during	 the
financial	meltdown.	I	expected	the	Fed	to	eventually	expand	quantitative	easing
to	include	the	purchase	of	longer-term	US	Treasurys.	I	thought	that	if	and	when
such	an	announcement	occurred,	it	would	trigger	an	instantaneous,	massive	rally
in	T-bonds.	March	18,	2009	was	the	day	when	the	Fed	announced	an	expansion
in	quantitative	easing,	which,	for	the	first	time,	included	the	purchase	of	longer-
term	Treasurys.

**Did	 you	 take	 a	 large	 position	 immediately	 after	 the	 announcement	 was
made?**

Not	as	large	as	I	would	have	liked.	At	the	time,	my	permissible	limit	in	T-note
futures	was	300	contracts.	In	anticipation	of	the	event,	I	explained	to	the	risk
manager	 why	 I	 wanted	 an	 increase	 in	 my	 position	 limit	 in	 T-notes	 to	 600
contracts.	I	was	only	requesting	the	increase	in	my	risk	limit	for	T-notes	for	this
one	anticipated	trade,	and	I	even	offered	to	reduce	or	give	up	my	position	limits
in	 other	 markets	 as	 an	 offset	 to	 this	 higher	 requested	 risk	 level.	 The	 risk
manager,	 however,	 refused	 to	 increase	 my	 risk	 limit	 because	 I	 was	 still	 a
relatively	new	trader	and	in	a	drawdown	at	the	time.	Because	of	this	limitation,	I


also	took	a	limit	position	in	the	Bund	as	a	proxy	for	what	I	really	wanted	to	do:
double	the	T-note	position.	While	not	as	profitable	as	the	T-note	trade,	the	Bund
trade	contributed	significantly	to	my	outlier	return	that	day.

**How	big	was	the	move	in	T-notes	after	the	announcement?**

[Amrit	pulls	out	the	relevant	chart	and	shows	me	the	day	of	the	announcement.
The	 price	 bar	 for	 that	 day	 is	 four	 full	 points	 wide.	 I	 am	 struck	 by	 two
observations:	First,	the	rally	occurred	within	an	ongoing	downtrend	in	the	T-note
market.	Second,	the	high	of	the	announcement	day	was	within	a	few	ticks	of	the
rebound	high	and	was	followed	by	a	large	continued	price	slide.]

**Ironically,	going	long	was	a	great	trade	for	the	day,	but	it	would	have	been
buying	near	the	high	for	any	longer-term	trade.	How	long	did	you	hold	the
trade?**

Minutes.	I	was	very	quick	to	get	in	because	I	was	poised	for	that	one	trade.	The
order	 was	 prepared,	 and	 my	 finger	 was	 ready	 to	 click.	 My	 mind	 was	 totally
focused.	There	was	no	obstruction	between	the	newsfeed	and	me.	There	was	no
self-doubt	or	excitement	to	compromise	my	acting	on	the	trade.	I	was	in	a	state
of	flow.	I	was	looking	for	one	trade,	and	I	didn’t	care	about	anything	else.	When
the	market	surged	after	the	news,	I	intuitively	knew	that	the	price	move	was	so
quick	and	so	big	that	I	should	immediately	take	profits.	I	ended	up	selling	the
position	near	the	high.

**So,	 the	 high	 of	 the	 move	 was	 made	 only	 a	 few	 minutes	 after	 the
announcement.**

Yes.

**How	much	did	you	make	on	that	trade?**

I	made	over	$1	million	in	two	or	three	minutes	of	trading!	This	was	the	moment
that	opened	my	eyes	to	the	opportunity	trading	offered	to	a	young,	hungry,	and
disciplined	risk-taker.

**Do	you	remember	your	emotional	state	after	the	trade	was	completed?**

It’s	embarrassing	thinking	back	on	it	now,	but	I	had	a	very	ungrateful	reaction.	It
was	 a	 mixed	 bag.	 Of	 course,	 it	 was	 nice	 having	 such	 a	 great	 day.	 However,
almost	instantly,	I	fell	back	into	a	negative	mindset.

**Why?**

I	didn’t	feel	like	I	made	$1	million;	I	felt	like	I	lost	out	on	making	$1	million.	It
was	such	an	easy	trade	that	I	wish	I	had	more,	and	I	did	try	to	get	more.

**So,	you	were	actually	upset	because	you	didn’t	have	double	the	position	you**


**wanted?**

Looking	back	at	it	now,	I	am	filled	with	gratitude,	but	that	was	not	how	I	felt
then.	That	was	another	part	of	the	journey.

**When	you	put	on	a	huge	position	like	the	quantitative	easing	trade,	do	you
use	a	stop?**

Back	then,	I	didn’t	necessarily,	but	I	do	now.	Getting	a	stop	in	place	is	a	hard-
and-fast	rule	for	me	now.

**Do	you	enter	the	stop	at	the	same	time	you	place	the	order?**

No,	because	I	don’t	want	the	market	whipping	back	and	immediately	taking	out
my	stop.	Once	there	has	been	enough	price	movement	to	avoid	getting	stopped
out	artificially,	I	will	put	my	stop	in.	It	is	essential	to	have	that	protection	on
because	once	you	have	a	position,	there	is	always	the	possibility	of	news	coming
out	adverse	to	your	position,	and	you	may	not	be	able	to	get	out	quickly	enough.
Having	a	stop	in	eliminates	that	tail	risk.

**When	did	you	start	using	stops	religiously?**

After	I	had	my	worst	daily	loss,	a	24%	hit.

**When	was	that,	and	what	happened?**

The	trade	occurred	in	June	2013,	and	it	was	a	comedy	of	errors.	The	ECB	had
been	touting	the	possibility	of	negative	interest	rates	for	some	time.	It	was	my
belief	that	if	and	when	they	went	to	negative	interest	rates,	it	would	be	very
bearish	for	the	euro.

**You	felt	that	way	even	though	the	prospect	for	negative	interest	rates	had
been	widely	discussed	and	people	were	sort	of	expecting	it?**

Yes,	because	it	would	still	have	been	a	market	shock	in	my	time	frame.	It	would
confirm	the	action,	and	once	the	ECB	went	to	negative	interest	rate	territory	by
any	amount,	it	would	raise	the	question	of	whether	even	more	negative	interest
rates	 might	 be	 in	 the	 offing.	 It	 would	 open	 up	 Pandora’s	 box.	 I	 am	 always
looking	for	a	trigger.	I	am	looking	for	a	moment	in	time	that	allows	me	to	place	a
leveraged	position	for	what	I	consider	to	be	a	potential	big	intraday	move.	If	the
trigger	looks	like	the	start	of	a	longer-term	price	move,	I	will	try	to	hold	part	of
the	 position.	 My	 approach	 doesn’t	 stop	 me	 from	 putting	 on	 a	 position	 on	 an
event	that	may	be	somewhat	priced	in	because	it	can	still	trigger	a	big	move	on
the	day	of	the	event,	which	is	all	I	need	to	place	the	trade.

**So	what	went	wrong	in	this	particular	situation?**

Mario	Draghi,	the	president	of	the	ECB,	was	giving	a	press	conference,	and	I


was	expecting	him	to	announce	a	move	to	negative	interest	rates.	When	he	was
asked	whether	the	ECB	was	ready	to	move	to	negative	interest	rates,	he	began
his	answer	by	saying,	“I	told	you	we	are	technically	ready...”	At	that	point,	I
went	short	without	waiting	for	him	to	finish	his	reply.	It	was	not	necessarily	a
mistake	to	go	short	in	anticipation	of	his	answer	because	I	knew	I	could	get	right
out	if	I	was	wrong	on	the	trade.	However,	the	moment	after	I	entered	my	sell
order,	my	computer	suddenly	powered	down.	At	the	same	time,	I	am	still	hearing
Draghi	on	the	TV	as	he	continues	and	says	the	magic	words,	“but	we	won’t	pre-
commit.”	I	knew	the	euro	was	going	to	soar	and	rip	my	face	off.

**What	did	you	do?**

I	panicked.	I	said	out	loud,	“My	computer	has	gone	off!	My	computer	has	gone
off!”	The	risk	manager	walked	over	to	my	desk	and	calmly	said,	“I	can	see	what
your	position	is.	Come	over	to	my	desk,	and	you	can	trade	out	of	it.”	I	am	used
to	getting	in	and	out	of	trades	quickly,	and	I	would’ve	been	out	of	that	trade
instantaneously	because	as	soon	as	I	heard	Draghi	finish	his	sentence,	I	knew	it
was	a	bad	trade.	Even	worse,	I	knew	there	was	a	lot	of	speculative	money	caught
on	the	wrong	side	of	the	trade,	and	I	would	normally	have	gone	long	after	I
heard	Draghi	say,	“but	we	won’t	pre-commit.”	My	best	trades	come	from	being
on	the	other	side	of	the	type	of	trade	I	was	in—namely,	trades	in	which	short-
term	speculators	have	it	wrong,	and	I	can	go	against	them.

**Are	you	implying	that	if	your	computer	hadn’t	gone	down,	you	would	have
reversed	your	position?**

I	would	definitely	have	attempted	to	reverse	my	position	very	quickly.

**What	happened	after	you	went	over	to	the	risk	manager’s	desk	to	trade	out
of	your	position?**

I	saw	that	the	euro	was	being	bought	quite	aggressively,	and	I	had	no	stop	in.
That	moment	ingrained	into	me	the	rule	that	I	have	to	get	my	stop	in	as	soon	as
possible.	[Sall	hits	the	desk	with	each	word	when	he	says,	“I	have	to	get	my	stop
in.”]	If	I	had	a	stop	on	that	trade,	my	loss	would	have	been	minimal.	Also,	now
that	my	trading	size	is	much	larger,	I	will	no	longer	take	anticipatory	trades.

**Did	you	get	out	right	after	you	went	to	the	risk	manager’s	desk,	or	did	you
wait	and	watch	the	position?**

I	got	out	right	away,	but	the	market	was	moving	so	quickly	that	I	had	already
taken	an	enormous	hit.

**What	caused	your	computer	to	power	down?**


I	believe	it	was	some	Windows	issue.

**That	has	got	to	be	the	worst	bad	luck	trading	story	I	have	ever	heard.	How
did	you	feel	after	that	loss?**

What	could	I	do?	I	realized	that	I	could	either	accept	it	and	move	on	or	let	it
affect	me	emotionally	in	ways	that	were	not	going	to	serve	me	well.	I	put	it
behind	me	as	quickly	as	I	could.	I	left	the	office,	and	later	that	day,	I	got	together
with	some	of	my	friends	at	the	local	bar.	We	had	what	I	called	a	“celebration”
because	I	wanted	to	shift	my	focus	to	the	positive	aspects	of	my	situation	rather
than	sulk	over	my	loss.	I	was	grateful	to	be	in	a	position	that	offered	so	much
potential	for	earnings.	The	fact	that	I	could	lose	so	much	money,	so	quickly,	only
reinforced	the	opportunity	I	had.	I	felt	I	was	in	the	right	job,	but	that	I	just	had	an
unlucky	moment.

**Your	choice	of	the	word	“celebration”	strikes	a	chord	with	the	conversation
I	 had	 with	 Richard	 yesterday	 [Richard	 Bargh,	 who	 was	 interviewed	 in
Chapter	3].	He	said	that	his	natural	tendency	after	a	bad	day	was	to	stop
spending	money	and	that	one	of	the	things	he	learned	from	you	was	that	he
should	instead	go	out	and	treat	himself.**

Richard	 and	 I	 had	 those	 conversations.	 After	 a	 bad	 trading	 day,	 I	 have	 two
options:	I	can	sit	there,	dwell	on	it,	and	let	it	hold	me	back,	or	I	can	flip	it	on	its
head	and	take	control	of	it.	After	a	big	hit,	I	try	to	minimize	the	impact	on	my
emotional	capital	by	returning	to	a	calm	and	centered	state	as	soon	as	I	can.	I	do
a	 postmortem	 on	 the	 trade,	 learn	 the	 lessons,	 and	 move	 on	 to	 the	 next
opportunity.	 After	 processing	 a	 big	 loss	 or	 drawdown,	 I	 have	 often	 treated
myself	from	a	place	of	gratitude	for	all	that	I	have	achieved	to	date.	Through	this
process,	I	avoid	the	trap	of	repeatedly	replaying	the	same	negative	story,	reliving
the	pain	multiple	times,	and	taxing	my	mental	capital.

**Is	 the	 thought	 of	 rewarding	 yourself	 or	 celebrating	 after	 you	 have
experienced	trading	losses	a	concept	you	instinctively	realized	was	a	good
idea	from	the	beginning?**

I	think	I	realized	it	after	doing	it	a	couple	of	times.	There	was	a	guy	in	the	office
who	used	to	say,	“Whenever	you	have	a	good	period	trading,	make	sure	you	treat
yourself,	so	you	know	why	you	are	doing	it.”

**But	you	were	treating	yourself	after	you	had	a	bad	period.	That’s	precisely
the	opposite.**

That’s	true.	For	me,	it’s	all	about	shifting	your	mindset.	You	want	to	get	your
mind	back	to	a	calm,	rational	place	rather	than	being	in	a	negative	and	stressed


state.	You	want	your	decisions	being	driven	by	your	prefrontal	cortex	rather	than
your	amygdala.	If	I	realize	I	am	having	a	tough	time,	I	will	ground	myself	and	be
grateful	for	the	journey.	Then	I	can	go	out	and	treat	myself.

The	ocean	provides	a	good	analogy.	The	ocean	surface	is	covered	with	waves
and	turbulence,	but	if	you	dive	down,	it	is	calm.	We	all	have	the	ability	in	us	to
dive	down	into	that	calm	region.	If	you	are	worried	about	missing	out	on	a	trade,
you	will	be	prone	to	take	trades	you	shouldn’t	be	taking.	If	you	are	emotionally
agitated,	you	may	snatch	your	profits	instead	of	letting	them	run,	or	you	may
hold	onto	your	losers.	You	need	to	pull	away	from	all	those	primitive	reactions
to	a	higher	self—a	calm	and	centered	person.

**Your	response	to	negative	trading	periods	is	180	degrees	opposite	to	what
the	natural	reaction	of	most	traders	would	be.	Most	traders	would	sulk	and
feel	horrible	if	they	had	a	terrible	trading	day,	like	your	huge	loss	because
your	computer	went	down	at	a	critical	moment.**

That’s	what	trading	is;	it’s	going	against	standard	human	emotions.	As	a	trader,
you	are	continually	going	up	against	your	own	emotional	limitations.	That	is
why	so	few	people	succeed	in	trading.

**How	long	did	it	take	you	to	get	centered	again	after	you	took	that	24%	hit
because	of	the	computer	glitch?**

Instantly.	I	made	all	the	money	back	within	seven	days.

**Was	there	a	big	trade	that	helped	you	recover	the	loss?**

No,	 it	 was	 more	 the	 cumulative	 effect	 of	 taking	 multiple	 trades	 that	 fit	 my
criteria.

**You	mentioned	the	importance	of	shifting	your	mindset	to	a	calm	state.
When	did	you	come	to	this	realization?**

I	noticed	that,	periodically,	I	would	go	through	losing	periods	for	no	discernible
reason.	So,	I	started	to	keep	an	error	log	of	marginal	trades	that	were	resulting	in
losses.

Underlying	 subconscious	 thoughts,	 emotions,	 and	 behaviors	 can	 drive	 our
actions	and	adversely	impact	trading.	I	came	from	a	working-class	family	where
money	wasn’t	abundant	the	way	it	is	for	me	now.	In	the	early	days,	I	felt	I	often
self-sabotaged	and	took	subpar	trades	following	record	winning	periods	as	a	way
to	self	regulate	and	“come	back	down	to	earth.”	Keeping	a	log	of	these	subpar
trades	allowed	me	to	become	aware	of	these	automatic	response	patterns.

[Sall	pulls	out	a	chart	to	illustrate	the	connection	between	emotions	and	losses.


The	emotional	state	is	on	the	x-axis,	with	descriptions	ranging	from	“calm”	on
the	left	end	to	“fear	of	missing	out”	on	the	right	end.	The	magnitude	of	the	loss
on	marginal	trades,	which	Sall	labels	as	“leakage”	to	indicate	the	losses	were
avoidable,	is	on	the	y-axis.	The	graph	shows	a	clear	pattern	of	the	magnitude	of
losses	moving	from	near	flat	in	the	calm	region	to	increasingly	larger	levels	as
the	emotional	state	becomes	more	excited.]

This	chart	helped	me	realize	the	underlying	cause	of	these	losing	periods.	To
make	the	most	of	your	trading	opportunities	and	to	minimize	making	bad	trades,
it	 all	 comes	 down	 to	 your	 state	 of	 mind,	 which	 is	 probably	 the	 most	 critical
factor	to	trading	success	once	you	have	your	methodology	down.	I	want	to	stay
in	the	calm	region—that	zone	where	things	flow	through	you.	The	only	way	I
could	be	successful	in	making	millisecond	decisions	for	large	amounts	of	money
is	by	accessing	that	calm	state.

I	once	read	that	the	US	Navy	Seals	use	neurofeedback	and	biofeedback	to	help
them	access	flow	states	on	demand	when	in	combat.	I	also	read	that	the	hardest
part	 of	 a	 Seal’s	 job	 was	 knowing	 when	 not	 to	 shoot.	 These	 observations
resonated	with	me.	I	thought	that	if	I	could	learn	to	access	a	similar	state	of	mind
on	demand,	it	might	allow	me	to	process	a	lot	more	information	and	get	better	at
knowing	when	“not	to	shoot.”	This	goal	led	me	on	a	journey	of	understanding
the	interconnection	between	the	mind	and	body,	and	exploring	meditation	and
flow	states.

**Expound	on	how	you	get	into	a	flow	state	and	how	it	impacts	your	trading.**

Before	 a	 significant	 trade	 event,	 I	 go	 through	 breath	 work	 and	 meditation	 to
center	in	on	the	present	moment	and	transcend	the	chatter	in	my	mind.	Over
time,	I	have	learned	how	to	access	flow	states	within	a	few	minutes.	The	ability
to	access	flow	is	fundamental	for	success	in	trading	and	many	other	endeavors,
such	as	professional	sports.	When	I	am	deeply	present,	everything	feels	easy.	In
this	“deep	now”	state,	I’m	reacting	from	a	subconscious	level	that	represents
95%	of	the	mind’s	potential	versus	5%	for	the	conscious	mind.	In	this	state,	I’m
creative,	 and	 I	 can	 process	 large	 amounts	 of	 information	 and	 react	 without
hesitation.	I’m	open	to	new	information	and	evolve	my	positions	accordingly.
Trading	feels	easy,	and	I’m	not	trying	to	force	anything,	I	have	no	attachment	to
my	position	or	the	outcome.	I	cut	losses	without	hesitation,	and	I	run	my	winners
without	any	impulse	to	snatch	profits.

In	 contrast,	 when	 I	 have	 difficulty	 transcending	 my	 mind	 before	 an	 event,
everything	 I	 do	 will	 feel	 like	 a	 struggle.	 I	 will	 miss	 out	 on	 valuable	 bits	 of


information.	I	will	hesitate	to	put	on	correct	positions	because	of	self-doubt,	and
I	will	get	out	of	winning	trades	way	too	soon.

Through	experience,	I	have	learned	that	when	my	gut	tells	me	that	something	is
off,	regardless	of	what	my	research	indicates,	my	gut	is	usually	right.	Learning
to	trust	my	gut	has	been	pivotal	to	my	success;	it	tells	me	when	a	trade	is	a
unicorn,	and	I	should	go	all	in,	and	when	there	may	be	unseen	danger,	and	I
should	hold	my	fire.

**Before,	you	said	the	opposite	side	of	your	worst	losing	trade,	which	was
caused	by	your	computer	going	down,	was	an	example	of	your	best	type	of
trade.	Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	this	type	of	trade	that	was	a	big	win?**

I	 always	 look	 for	 situations	 where	 the	 market	 initially	 moves	 in	 the	 wrong
direction	in	response	to	an	event,	and	then	I	can	go	the	other	way.	This	is	the
same	type	of	trade	I	was	on	the	wrong	side	of	when	my	computer	went	down.	A
perfect	example	occurred	recently	[September	2019]	when	the	ECB	announced	a
package	of	quantitative	easing	measures.

The	speculative	money	was	fixated	on	the	amount	of	monthly	purchases	with
expectations	in	the	€30–€40	billion	area.	But,	I	had	an	appreciation	that	the	total
purchase	amount	was	more	important	than	the	monthly	flow.	My	gut	told	me
that	the	fast	money	was	looking	for	any	excuse	to	sell	disappointment.	When	the
newswires	reported	that	purchases	would	equal	€20	billion	per	month,	the	fast
money	 reacted	 in	 disappointment,	 with	 the	 Bund	 selling	 off,	 and	 the	 euro
rallying.	I	had	decided	that,	in	this	instance,	it	was	best	to	wait	to	review	all	the
information	before	making	a	trade,	and	I	maintained	a	calm,	flow	state,	digesting
the	full	statement.	When	I	saw	that	the	monthly	purchase	commitment	was	open-
ended,	 I	 knew	 that	 all	 the	 weak	 shorts	 would	 have	 to	 quickly	 unwind	 their
speculative	positions.	At	that	moment,	and	just	at	that	moment,	the	market	was
mispriced,	so	boom,	I	took	the	killer	shot	and	went	against	the	herd.	The	trade
worked	for	a	couple	of	hours	before	disappointment	set	in	once	more,	and	the
market	again	reversed.	But,	by	that	time,	I	had	made	my	money	and	was	out	of
the	trade.	You	could	argue	I	was	ultimately	on	the	wrong	side	of	the	trade,	but	I
was	trading	against	a	mispricing	of	speculative	positions,	and	in	my	time	frame,
I	was	right.	

The	thing	with	short-term	trading	is	that	you	can	be	“right”	and	lose	money.	The
traders	who	went	short	in	response	to	the	initial	announcement	were	ultimately
right,	 but	 unless	 they	 were	 able	 to	 hold	 onto	 their	 positions	 through	 a	 sharp
pullback,	they	would	have	lost	money.	Looking	at	the	trade	from	a	longer-term


perspective,	I	was	technically	on	the	“wrong”	side	of	the	trade.	Nevertheless,
because	I	had	an	appreciation	of	how	the	positioning	of	short-term	traders	might
impact	prices,	I	was	able	to	place	a	very	profitable	short-term	trade.

**What	percent	of	your	profits	come	from	one-day	trades?**

Probably	around	75%.

**What	is	the	characteristic	of	the	minority	of	trades	you	hold	for	a	longer
period?**

The	longer-term	trades	are	still	triggered	by	the	same	type	of	events	as	my	short-
term	trades,	but	a	small	percentage	of	those	trades	have	long-term	potential.

**Yes,	but	what	is	the	characteristic	of	those	trades	that	suggest	they	have
long-term	potential?**

Entirely	unexpected	events	that	have	significant	long-term	implications	for	the
economy	 can	 fuel	 long-term	 price	 moves.	 The	 unanticipated	 outcome	 of	 the
Brexit	vote	and	its	aftermath	provide	a	perfect	example	of	a	trade	that	had	legs.

**How	do	you	decide	when	to	get	out	of	a	trade?**

I	have	an	uncanny	knack	for	picking	half-decent	places	to	liquidate.	I’m	working
on	translating	my	discretionary	liquidation	decisions	into	systematic	rules,	but	I
am	not	there	yet.	Also,	if	there	is	a	parabolic	price	move	on	an	intraday	time
frame	on	a	position	I	hold,	I	will	lock	in	the	profit.	I	learned	this	rule	the	hard
way	when	I	have	held	onto	such	positions,	thinking	they	would	go	much	further,
only	to	give	back	a	chunk	of	the	profits.

**Except	for	that	one	trade	when	your	computer	went	down,	you	have	been
very	 effective	 in	 managing	 risk,	 especially	 considering	 the	 magnitude	 of
your	 returns.	 I	 know	 an	 essential	 element	 of	 your	 risk	 management	 is
getting	out	immediately	if	a	trade	doesn’t	act	as	you	expected.	What	are	the
other	ingredients	in	your	risk	management?**

In	terms	of	individual	trades,	I	vary	my	risk	between	1%	and	5%,	depending	on
my	conviction	level.	As	I	mentioned	earlier,	I	get	stops	in	on	my	positions	as
soon	as	possible.	I	will	also	take	partial	profits	on	trades	rather	than	holding	the
full	position	until	exit.	Taking	partial	profits	allows	me	to	lock	in	“free	trades”
that	offer	unlimited	upside	but	zero	downside	after	I’ve	taken	profit	on	part	of
the	position.	It’s	like	owning	a	free	call	option	in	a	market	I	think	should	rally
hard.

At	the	portfolio	level,	when	I	hit	a	6%	drawdown,	I	 _may_ 	start	scaling	back	my
size	and	become	much	more	selective	on	new	trades	I	put	on.	It	depends	on	the


circumstances.	At	times	I	have	lost	5%	in	one	trade	and	felt	OK	about	it	and	kept
my	trading	size	unchanged.	At	other	times,	I	have	been	on	a	slow	bleed	losing
money	over	a	long	period,	which	usually	means	the	market	is	in	a	lull	period,	or
I’m	out	of	sync	with	the	market.	In	such	instances,	I	will	begin	cutting	size	back
and	tighten	up	my	criteria	to	take	only	dead	certain	trades.

**Have	you	made	any	significant	changes	to	your	trading	approach	in	recent
years,	and	if	so,	why?**

In	the	past,	I	have	tended	to	implement	trading	ideas	in	a	single	market.	I	now
try	 to	 execute	 trade	 ideas	 in	 multiple	 correlated	 markets.	 For	 example,	 I	 will
place	simultaneous	positions	in	the	Bund,	Euro	Stoxx	index,	and	the	euro,	or	at
least	two	out	of	three,	rather	than	just	one	of	these	markets.	The	reason	for	this
change	is	that,	sometimes,	if	the	trade	is	not	working	in	one	of	these	markets,	it
doesn’t	mean	there	is	something	wrong	with	the	trade	hypothesis;	it	may	just	be
that	something	is	going	on	in	that	market	that	is	keeping	the	trade	from	working.
A	good	example	occurred	after	an	FOMC	meeting	that	suggested	the	potential
for	lower	rates.	I	bought	T-notes	and	the	S&P.	The	T-note	position	didn’t	do
anything	initially;	it	was	even	down	a	bit.	That	didn’t	mean	the	trade	was	not
valid.	If	I	was	only	in	the	T-note	position	and	wasn’t	also	in	the	S&P,	which
rallied,	I	would	have	been	more	inclined	to	conclude	that	my	trade	hypothesis
was	wrong,	which	turned	out	not	to	be	the	case.	What	had	happened	was	that
there	was	an	impending	auction	weighing	down	the	interest	rate	markets,	and
once	 the	 auction	 was	 out	 of	 the	 way,	 T-notes	 never	 looked	 back.	 So	 I	 have
learned	not	to	concentrate	my	trade	ideas	in	a	single	market.

Over	time,	increased	market	automation	and	high-frequency-trading	algorithms
have	made	execution	harder	and	eroded	my	edge	on	some	very	short	time	frame
strategies.	As	a	result,	I	focus	primarily	on	higher	conviction	trades	and	trade
less	frequently	during	the	month,	but	take	on	more	risk	per	trade	to	reflect	the
conviction	level.

**What	are	some	trading	misconceptions	you	have	seen	that	cause	people	to
fail?**

A	 lot	 of	 losing	 traders	 I	 have	 known	 thought	 they	 had	 to	 make	 money
consistently.	They	had	a	paycheck	mentality;	they	felt	they	had	to	make	a	certain
amount	every	month.	The	reality	is	that	you	may	go	through	long	periods	when
you	don’t	make	anything,	or	even	have	a	drawdown,	and	then	have	a	substantial
gain.	Entrepreneurs	understand	that.	They	will	invest	in	a	company	for	a	long
time,	and	the	payoff	comes	in	one	hit	after	many	years	of	hard	work.	If	you	are


looking	 for	 outsize	 profits,	 you	 can’t	 approach	 that	 goal	 with	 a	 mindset	 of
consistency.	At	best,	I	am	right	only	50%	of	the	time,	and	sometimes	I	am	right
only	30%	of	the	time.	However,	when	I’m	right	only	30%	of	the	time,	I	am
earning	eight	times	as	much	on	my	winners	as	I	am	losing	on	my	losers.	Traders
have	to	ask	themselves	whether	they	can	handle	being	right	only	30%	of	the
time,	 or	 do	 they	 feel	 they	 have	 to	 be	 right	 day	 after	 day?	 It	 is	 that	 latter
perspective	that	holds	a	lot	of	people	back.

**What	else	causes	traders	to	fail?**

Losing	traders	will	get	locked	into	a	state	of	negativity.	They	will	let	their	losses
affect	them.	It	is	a	snowball	effect.	They	will	have	a	loss,	and	another	loss,	and
another	loss,	and	then,	all	of	a	sudden,	they	are	in	this	really	dark	place	in	their
heads	where	it	is	too	late	to	escape	because	they	have	compounded	all	those
negative	thoughts.	If	they	had	killed	the	negative	reinforcement	process	at	the
root	by	controlling	their	emotions	after	the	first	loss,	they	would’ve	been	in	a
much	better	position.

Also,	working	in	a	trading	office	for	13	years,	I’ve	seen	a	lot	of	people	just	trade
and	hope;	they	don’t	last	long.	You	need	to	manage	risk.

**How	about	successful	traders—do	they	share	any	common	traits?**

```
Successful	traders	take	care	of	the	downside	and	know	that	the	upside	will
take	care	of	itself.
They	never	give	up.	Even	when	things	go	badly,	they	will	find	a	way	to
push	through	and	know	everything	will	be	fine.
They	are	competitive	within	themselves	and	are	always	looking	for	ways	to
improve	performance	month	after	month.
They	believe	in	their	edge	and	realize	that	each	trade	is	mutually	exclusive
—a	 perspective	 that	 allows	 them	 to	 pull	 the	 trigger	 every	 single	 time,
regardless	of	the	outcome	of	the	preceding	trades.
They	 embrace	 failure	 as	 feedback.	 They	 understand	 that	 failure	 is	 a
necessity	 on	 the	 path	 to	 success	 in	 any	 endeavor.	 They	 realize	 that
something	is	a	failure	only	if	they	miss	the	opportunity	to	learn	from	it.
```
**Your	return/risk	performance	represents	one	of	the	best	track	records	I
have	ever	encountered.	What	skills	or	personal	qualities	do	you	believe	have
enabled	you	to	achieve	these	results?**


I	am	very	aware	of	the	characteristics	of	a	good	trade,	and	I	don’t	hesitate
when	such	a	trade	presents	itself.

I	am	always	looking	for	asymmetric	return/risk	trade	profiles.	I	want	to	cap
my	risk	every	time,	and	when	I	capture	a	unicorn,	I	want	to	ride	it	until	it
throws	me	off.

I’m	not	looking	for	instant	gratification;	I	put	in	the	work	and	then	wait
patiently	for	the	right	trade.	I	can	stay	in	a	state	of	readiness,	so	when	the
big	 trade	 comes,	 I	 don’t	 hesitate.	 I	 can	 go	 from	 zero	 to	 a	 hundred
instantaneously.	That	approach	works	for	me.	Other	people	may	feel	they
have	to	be	doing	something	every	day;	I	don’t.

I	 am	 rigorous	 about	 managing	 my	 downside	 and	 preserving	 my	 mental
capital	in	between	big	winning	trades.

I	 don’t	 attach	 myself	 to	 the	 outcome	 of	 a	 trade.	 I	 keep	 my	 focus	 on
following	a	process.

I	am	good	at	discerning	between	high	conviction	and	low	conviction	trades,
and	I	vary	my	position	size	accordingly.

I	am	aggressive	when	there	is	a	trading	opportunity,	and	I	back	away	from
the	market	just	as	quickly	when	the	opportunity	passes.

I	am	disciplined,	which	allows	me	to	leverage	aggressively	when	there	is	a
major	trade	opportunity.	

I	am	always	trying	to	learn	from	my	mistakes,	and	I	have	a	process	to	avoid
making	the	same	mistakes	again.

I	never	give	up.	In	the	first	seven	months	of	this	year	[2019],	I	was	in	a
drawdown.	That	hasn’t	happened	to	me	since	my	early	years	of	trading.
You	need	to	have	the	resilience	to	last	through	the	difficult	periods.

I	am	willing	to	outwork	everyone	else.	In	my	early	years,	I	used	to	get	up	at
4	 a.m.	 or	 5	 a.m.	 to	 get	 fully	 updated	 on	 any	 overnight	 news.	 I	 used	 to
sometimes	put	in	15-	to	18-hour	days.

To	succeed	as	a	trader,	you	need	to	have	a	fire	in	your	belly;	it’s	the	only
way	you’ll	keep	coming	back	after	being	kicked	down	repeatedly.	I	have
that	determination.

I	think	the	most	significant	single	factor	to	any	success	I	have	had	as	a
trader	 is	 my	 inner	 focus:	 self-reflection,	 self-awareness,	 journaling,


```
meditation,	and	breathwork.	In	particular,	my	ability	to	get	into	a	flow	state
is	the	essence	of	who	I	am	and,	when	combined	with	in-depth	research,	is
my	edge.
```
**What	do	you	know	now	that	you	wish	you	knew	when	you	started?**

It’s	what	you	don’t	do	that	counts.	Patience	is	the	key	word.	Successful	trading	is
the	 art	 of	 doing	 nothing.	 It’s	 what	 you	 don’t	 do	 between	 the	 real	 trade
opportunities	that	will	determine	your	success	over	the	long	run.	You	can	do	so
much	damage	to	your	mental	capital	between	trades	that	when	the	big	trade	turns
up,	you	are	not	ready	for	it.

**So,	it’s	not	so	much	the	losses	you	might	take	on	suboptimal	trades	that	is
the	problem,	but	rather	the	major	trade	opportunities	you	will	be	prone	to
miss	because	of	the	adverse	impact	of	such	marginal	trades	on	your	focus
and	mindset.**

That	is	exactly	right.

**Do	you	have	any	last	words?**

Trading	has	been	a	wonderful	journey	of	self-discovery	and	growth	for	me,	and	I
am	happy	to	share	the	story	of	my	ups	and	downs	and	what	I	believe	it	takes	to
succeed	over	the	long	run.	The	last	decade	of	trading	feels	like	a	warm-up,	and
I’m	excited	to	see	my	growth	in	the	coming	years	ahead.

Sall’s	incredible	success	as	a	trader	is	due	to	a	trading	process	that	combines
three	essential	components:

```
1 .	 Trade	Research	and	Planning —Successful	 trading	 is	 not	 a	 shoot-from-
the-hip	 approach;	 instead,	 it	 is	 a	 matter	 of	 hard	 work.	 Sall	 prepares
assiduously	for	every	trade.	He	has	compiled	thousands	of	pages	of	notes,
chronicling	all	his	past	trades.	For	each	of	these	trades,	he	documented	his
trading	plan,	the	details	of	the	relevant	event	and	market	response,	and	what
he	got	right	and	wrong.	These	trade	notes,	which	are	categorized,	allow	Sall
to	identify	and	study	historical	analogues	to	prospective	trades.	Using	this
personally	compiled	research	library,	Sall	prepares	a	highly	detailed	write-
up	for	each	contemplated	trade—a	plan	that	encompasses	a	wide	range	of
scenarios	as	to	how	the	trade	might	evolve	in	real	time.	Sall	also	vigilantly
```

```
watches	the	newswire	all	day	for	any	unexpected	events	that	might	offer
trade	opportunities.
2 .	 Trade	Execution —The	types	of	trades	that	Sall	terms	“unicorns,”	which
account	 for	 the	 vast	 majority	 of	 his	 profits,	 require	 instantaneous
discretionary	decisions.	There	is	no	time	for	contemplation	and	analysis.
Sall	 has	 to	 know	 what	 he	 will	 do	 for	 each	 possible	 circumstance	 as	 an
event,	such	as	a	central	bank	statement,	unfolds.	Even	taking	a	minute	or
two	 to	 think	 the	 trade	 over	 would	 typically	 result	 in	 missing	 the	 trade
opportunity.	To	make	sound	trading	decisions	virtually	reflexively	when	an
event	happens,	Sall	prepares	by	conducting	in-depth	research	and	planning,
described	in	item	1.	In	addition,	Sall	engages	in	visualization	and	mental
rehearsal	as	to	how	he	will	respond	in	a	variety	of	circumstances,	much	as
some	professional	athletes	do	before	a	big	game	or	major	competition.	He
also	gets	into	a	“deep	now”	state	through	meditation	and	breathwork.
3 .	 Emotional	Calm —Sall	 considers	 maintaining	 the	 appropriate	 emotional
state—calm,	 centered,	 focused—as	 absolutely	 essential	 to	 being	 a
successful	 trader.	 He	 is	 scrupulous	 in	 avoiding	 a	 negative	 mindset	 or
allowing	 a	 trade	 loss	 or	 trading	 mistake	 to	 impact,	 let	 alone	 derail,	 a
subsequent	trade	opportunity.	Sall	will	short-circuit	any	potential	negative
mental	 spiral	 before	 it	 gets	 going.	 When	 he	 is	 in	 a	 drawdown	 or	 has
experienced	a	particularly	bad	trading	day,	Sall	will	break	any	burgeoning
negative	mindset	by	focusing	instead	on	all	the	things	he	is	grateful	for.	In
Sall’s	words,	“It’s	all	about	shifting	your	mindset.	You	want	to	get	your
mind	back	to	a	calm,	rational	place.”	Maintaining	a	positive	mindset	and	a
calm	 emotional	 state	 is	 not	 an	 auxiliary	 component	 of	 Sall’s	 trading
process;	it	is	an	absolute	core	part	of	it.
```
The	idea	of	treating	yourself	when	trading	is	going	poorly	is	a	unique	piece	of
advice.	 It	 is	 a	 concept	 that	 was	 never	 mentioned	 by	 any	 of	 the	 traders	 I
interviewed	in	previous	 _Market	Wizards_ 	books.	It	has	worked	well	for	Sall,	but	is
it	good	advice	for	traders	in	general?	I	don’t	know,	but	individual	traders	can
experiment	with	the	idea.	However,	what	is	certainly	good	advice	for	all	traders
is	Sall’s	more	general	point	that	successful	trading	requires	a	positive	mindset
and	a	calm,	focused	emotional	state.

Patience	 is	 an	 inherent	 trait	 shared	 by	 many	 of	 the	 great	 traders	 I	 have
interviewed.	For	Sall,	patience	lies	at	the	very	essence	of	his	trading	success.
This	 assessment	 is	 best	 illustrated	 in	 Sall’s	 own	 words	 describing	 his	 trading


style	in	our	email	correspondence	before	the	interview:	“My	style	has	often	been
referred	to	that	of	a	sniper.	I	am	in	a	constant	state	of	readiness	waiting	for	that
perfect	shot.	I	don’t	want	to	waste	my	bullets	doing	anything	else	because	it	will
jeopardize	my	ability	to	take	that	perfect	shot.	I	wait	for	a	trade	that	I	intuitively
know	is	right,	and	then	I	will	take	the	shot.	The	rest	of	the	time,	I	sit	still	and
patiently	wait.”

Sall	believes	that	doing	nothing	between	the	genuine	trade	opportunities	is	far
more	 challenging	 than	 executing	 the	 trades	 responsible	 for	 the	 bulk	 of	 his
profits.	Having	the	patience	to	avoid	the	temptation	of	taking	suboptimal	trades
is	essential	for	two	reasons.	First,	these	trades	will	tend	to	be	net	losers.	Second,
and	 even	 more	 importantly,	 the	 negative	 impact	 of	 these	 trades	 on	 a	 trader’s
mental	state	and	focus	may	result	in	missing	the	really	big	trade	opportunities.
The	lesson	is:	Only	take	trades	that	fit	your	rules	and	avoid	the	marginal	trades.

Ironically,	striving	for	performance	consistency,	which	sounds	like	a	worthwhile
goal,	can	be	a	flaw	rather	than	a	virtue.	Sall	says	that	a	common	trait	he	observed
among	traders	who	failed	is	that	they	had	a	goal	of	making	money	every	month.
Why	is	this	an	undesirable	objective?	The	explanation	lies	in	the	fact	that	the
markets	don’t	provide	opportunities	on	a	regular	schedule.	Consequently,	a	goal
of	making	profits	every	month	will	entice	traders	to	take	trades	that	are	based
more	on	hope	than	methodology	when	genuine	trade	opportunities	are	lacking.
In	effect,	the	quest	for	consistency	will	lead	traders	to	act	in	diametric	opposition
to	the	sound	principle	of	patience.

The	 trades	 that	 Sall	 has	 the	 patience	 to	 wait	 for	 have	 two	 essential
characteristics:

```
1 .	They	 are	 trades	 he	 perceives	 have	 a	 high	 probability	 of	 moving	 in	 the
anticipated	direction.
2 .	They	are	asymmetric	trades:	the	potential	gain	far	exceeds	the	risk	taken.
```
Sall	will	take	large	positions	on	these	high-conviction	trades.	The	wide	variation
in	 his	 position	 sizing—specifically,	 taking	 much	 larger	 positions	 on	 high-
conviction	 trades—is	 an	 essential	 factor	 in	 Sall’s	 ability	 to	 generate	 outsized
gains.

To	limit	the	loss	on	any	single	trade,	Sall	will	always	place	a	protective	stop
order	as	soon	as	practical.	Because	Sall	trades	large	positions	based	on	events—
times	when	markets	are	particularly	volatile—placing	stops	at	the	time	of	order


entry	 would	 run	 too	 high	 a	 risk	 of	 a	 position	 getting	 stopped	 out	 on	 a
meaningless,	momentary	price	gyration.	Instead,	Sall	will	wait	for	the	market	to
move	enough	in	his	direction	so	that	his	stop	will	only	be	triggered	if	the	trade
idea	fails.	What	if	the	market	moves	against	him	before	he	can	place	a	stop?
Since	 Sall	 is	 very	 quick	 to	 liquidate	 his	 position	 if	 the	 market	 fails	 to
immediately	react	as	anticipated,	a	straight	market	order	will	serve	to	contain	his
loss	in	these	instances.

Winning	 breeds	 complacency.	 When	 trading	 is	 going	 particularly	 well,	 many
traders	will	tend	to	get	lax	in	both	their	trade	entry	and	money	management.
They	will	be	more	prone	to	take	trades	they	normally	wouldn’t	and	to	be	less
rigorous	 in	 their	 risk	 control.	 After	 one	 strong	 winning	 period,	 Sall	 found
himself	 falling	 into	 this	 trap	 when	 he	 placed	 limit	 positions	 in	 three	 highly
correlated	markets	on	a	marginal	trade.	A	query	as	to	what	he	was	doing	by	the
company’s	risk	manager	brought	Sall	back	to	his	senses,	and	he	liquidated	all	his
trades.	The	risk	manager’s	intervention	helped	avert	a	possible	significant	loss.
Still,	the	experience	helped	Sall	learn	the	lesson	to	caution	against	getting	cocky
and	 loosening	 trade	 discipline	 after	 extensive	 winning	 periods—a	 valuable
lesson	for	virtually	all	traders.

If	you	ever	find	yourself	in	a	trade	based	on	hope,	get	out.	You	need	conviction,
not	hope,	to	stay	in	a	trade.	Sall’s	use	of	technical-based	trade	triggers	early	in
his	career	resulted	in	trades	with	little	conviction	that	he	hoped	would	work.	His
unease	with	hoping	trades	would	work	convinced	him	that	technical	trading	was
the	wrong	path	for	him.

Sall	provides	an	excellent	example	of	a	trader	whose	exceptional	success	was
greatly	abetted	by	an	extreme	work	ethic.	I	am	often	asked	whether	hard	work
alone	is	enough	to	become	a	successful	trader	or	whether	great	traders	succeed
because	they	have	some	innate	skill.	Although	hard	work	and	risk	management
are	critical	to	trading	success,	they	are	not	sufficient	to	explain	the	magnitude	of
performance	achieved	by	exceptional	traders.	These	traders	also	possess	innate
skill.	Sall’s	comment	about	how	he	decides	where	to	get	out	of	trades	is	telling:
“I	 have	 an	 uncanny	 knack	 for	 picking	 half-decent	 places	 to	 liquidate.”	 The
words	“uncanny	knack”	reflect	an	intuitive	skill	that	cannot	be	taught	or	learned.

Running	 a	 marathon	 provides	 a	 good	 analogy.	 Most	 people,	 if	 they	 are
sufficiently	committed	and	work	hard	enough,	can	run	a	marathon,	which	is	an
impossible	task	without	lots	of	preparation	and	training.	However,	regardless	of
the	degree	of	dedication	or	amount	of	hard	work,	only	a	small	fraction	of	people


have	the	body	type	that	would	permit	running	a	marathon	at	a	world-class	pace.
Similarly,	 with	 enough	 work	 and	 dedication,	 combined	 with	 effective	 risk
management,	 a	 significant	 percentage	 of	 people	 could	 become	 at	 least
marginally	profitable	traders,	but	only	a	small	percentage	possess	the	intrinsic
skill	to	become	Market	Wizards.

Sall	creates	detailed	write-ups	of	all	his	trades	and	periodically	reviews	these
trade	logs.	One	reason	he	performs	this	exercise	is	to	compile	a	historical	record
of	market	behavior	in	specific	situations	to	serve	as	guidelines	for	what	to	expect
in	future	similar	circumstances.	However,	another	critical	reason	he	creates	and
reviews	this	trade	documentation	is	to	learn	from	his	past	mistakes	so	he	can
avoid	repeating	them.	Maintaining	and	periodically	reviewing	a	written	analysis
of	your	trades	that	includes	reasons	for	entry	and	exit,	as	well	as	what	you	did
right	and	wrong,	is	a	valuable	exercise	for	all	traders.	It	provides	a	useful	tool	for
recognizing	trading	mistakes,	which	is	the	first	step	to	avoid	repeating	the	same
mistakes	 in	 the	 future.	 Learning	 from	 mistakes	 is	 how	 you	 become	 a	 better
trader.

Great	traders	tend	to	be	very	confident	in	their	abilities.	Yes,	I	know	they	may	be
confident	simply	because	they	are	successful.	However,	I	think	for	these	traders,
confidence	is	an	inherent	trait	that	may	precede	and	be	independent	of	success.
Sall	provides	a	good	example	supporting	this	premise.	Even	after	his	account
balance	went	negative	in	his	first	trading	year	and	his	trading	career	was	in	peril,
he	was	still	confident	he	would	succeed.	An	honest	assessment	of	your	degree	of
confidence	in	your	trading	ability	is	one	way	to	gauge	whether	or	not	you	are
likely	to	succeed	as	a	trader.	If	you	are	ambiguous	or	doubtful	about	whether
your	trading	methodology	provides	an	edge,	you	should	be	particularly	cautious
regarding	the	amount	of	money	you	are	willing	to	risk.

If	you	have	the	skill	and	genuine	confidence	that	you	can	be	a	profitable	trader,
then	one	other	trait	is	necessary	to	succeed:	resilience.	Never	give	up.

explanation).


# Daljit	Dhaliwal: 	Know	Your	Edge

# DALJIT	Dhaliwal’s	 track	 record	 is	 extraordinary.	 In	 his	 nine-plus	 years	 of

trading,	 he	 has	 achieved	 a	 remarkable	 average	 annual	 compounded	 return	 of
298%.	He	trades	aggressively,	taking	large	positions	when	he	has	a	high	degree
of	confidence	in	a	trade.	His	average	annualized	volatility	is	extremely	high	at
84%.

So,	you	might	think,	“Sure,	his	returns	are	amazing,	but	his	risk	must	be	off	the
charts	 as	 well.”	 And,	 this	 presumption	 would	 seem	 to	 be	 supported	 by	 his
stratospheric	volatility.	But,	here’s	the	thing:	His	volatility	is	super	high	because
of	his	many	huge	gains;	his	downside	has	actually	been	remarkably	controlled.
Given	his	return	and	volatility	levels,	it	would	be	reasonable	to	expect	to	see
multiple	 drawdowns	 of	 50%	 or	 more.	 But	 Dhaliwal’s	 maximum	 drawdown,
based	on	monthly	ending	equity	levels,	is	under	20%.	He	has	been	profitable	in
all	years,	95%	of	quarters,	and	70%	of	months.	As	implied	by	his	combination	of
mammoth	returns	and	controlled	downside,	Dhaliwal’s	return/risk	statistics	are
exemplary:	an	adjusted	Sortino	ratio	of	10.3	and	a	monthly	Gain	to	Pain	ratio	of
8.5—numbers	 that	 are	 five	 times	 the	 levels	 of	 what	 could	 be	 considered
excellent	performance.	(See	Appendix	2	for	the	definitions	and	context	of	these
statistics.)

Dhaliwal’s	initial	passion	was	tennis,	not	trading.	As	a	teen,	he	was	a	promising
junior	player	in	the	UK,	and	he	had	hopes	of	becoming	a	professional.	When
Dhaliwal	 is	 committed	 to	 a	 goal,	 he	 goes	 all	 out	 in	 achieving	 it.	 He	 started
playing	tennis	at	the	relatively	late	age	of	ten	(late	for	an	aspiring	professional).
Dhaliwal	practiced	relentlessly,	receiving	instruction	from	professional	coaches
five	days	a	week.	The	reasons	why	he	abandoned	his	quest	to	become	a	tennis
professional	are	discussed	in	the	interview.

While	Dhaliwal	was	in	university,	the	2008	financial	meltdown	and	its	aftermath
sparked	his	interest	in	markets.	By	the	time	he	was	in	his	final	year	of	studies,
Dhaliwal	knew	he	wanted	to	be	a	trader.	The	problem	was	that	he	attended	a
mid-ranked	university,	and	trading	jobs	went	almost	exclusively	to	graduates	of
top	universities.	This	obstacle	was	especially	acute	when	he	graduated	in	the
post-financial-crisis	 period	 when	 trading	 jobs	 were	 particularly	 scarce	 and
competition	 for	 these	 positions	 fierce.	 By	 all	 logic,	 it	 should	 have	 been
impossible	for	Dhaliwal	to	land	a	trading	job—but	through	sheer	determination,
he	did.


Dhaliwal	attacked	trading	with	the	same	passion	and	commitment	he	had	for
tennis	 as	 a	 teen.	 He	 devoted	 himself	 to	 learning	 everything	 he	 could	 about
markets	and	trading.	Dhaliwal	had	the	sound	sense	to	realize	that	he	didn’t	know
anything	 when	 he	 started,	 and	 therefore,	 he	 did	 not	 harbor	 any	 preconceived
notions.	Instead,	he	studied	market	price	moves	and	their	causes,	to	learn	from
the	markets	how	to	interpret	different	events.

Dhaliwal’s	methodology	went	through	many	changes	as	he	evolved	as	a	trader.
Initially,	 he	 primarily	 used	 technical	 analysis,	 but	 he	 quickly	 shifted	 to	 a
fundamental	focus	when	he	realized	that	the	smaller	number	of	fundamentally
based	trades	were	the	source	of	nearly	all	his	trading	profits.	For	most	of	his
career,	Dhaliwal	placed	day	trades	based	on	his	interpretation	of	fundamental
events,	 such	 as	 central	 bank	 announcements.	 In	 recent	 years,	 he	 has	 shifted
increasingly	to	longer-term	trades	based	on	macroeconomic	models	he	and	his
research	assistant	have	developed.

Dhaliwal	spent	most	of	his	trading	career	as	part	of	the	same	group	as	Richard
Bargh	 (Chapter	 3)	 and	 Amrit	 Sall	 (Chapter	 4).	 A	 desire	 to	 operate	 more
independently	without	being	influenced	by	other	traders	prompted	Dhaliwal	to
move	to	his	own	London	office,	which	is	where	I	interviewed	him.	I	mentioned
to	Dhaliwal	that	I	was	interviewing	Michael	Kean	(see	Chapter	10)	the	following
day.	By	coincidence,	Dhaliwal	invests	with	Kean.	The	next	day	Dhaliwal	invited
both	of	us	to	a	terrific	dinner	at	Goodman,	a	steakhouse	in	the	City	of	London.

**How	would	you	define	your	trading	strategy?**

I	would	say	that	I	am	a	macro,	event-driven	trader.	On	the	quantitative	side,	I	am
using	 leading	 economic	 indicators	 and	 historical	 analogue	 models	 we	 have
developed.	 On	 the	 qualitative	 side,	 I	 use	 a	 short-term	 strategy	 of	 trading
headlines	 as	 a	 tactical	 tool	 for	 getting	 positioned	 in	 the	 market.	 Also,	 on	 the
qualitative	side,	I	use	my	understanding	of	narratives	that	may	be	driving	the
market,	which,	at	times,	could	overwhelm	the	fundamentals.

**Did	you	have	any	career	aspirations	as	a	teen?**

Probably	more	than	anything	else,	I	had	hopes	of	becoming	a	professional	tennis
player.	Tennis	was	a	big	part	of	my	life	in	high	school.

**Did	you	compete	professionally?**

I	never	made	it	to	the	international	level.	My	top	ranking	was	about	80	in	the


### UK.

**What	happened	to	that	career	pathway?**

When	I	was	about	16	years	old,	I	had	a	pivotal	conversation	with	one	of	the
coaches,	who	had	been	a	world-ranked	player.	He	said	he	loved	the	experience
of	competing	at	the	international	level	and	the	opportunity	it	gave	him	to	travel
the	world,	but	that	there	was	no	money	in	it.	At	that	point,	he	was	in	his	30s	and
studying	for	a	degree	to	start	a	new	career.

**Was	it	his	comment	about	the	limited	earning	potential	that	dampened	your
enthusiasm	to	pursue	a	career	as	a	professional	tennis	player?**

More	than	that,	it	was	the	idea	of	having	to	start	a	whole	new	career	at	that	stage
of	your	life.	I	didn’t	have	a	love	for	tennis	the	way	some	of	my	peers	did.	My
interest	in	tennis	didn’t	extend	beyond	the	possibility	of	becoming	a	pro.	I	knew
I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 become	 a	 tennis	 coach.	 There	 was	 also	 another	 formative
moment	about	a	year	later.	One	day,	my	coach	brought	in	someone	for	me	to
play	against.	We	played	a	set,	and	I	beat	him	6-4.	Afterward,	my	coach	told	me
the	player	I	had	just	beat	was	world-ranked	the	previous	year.	He	hadn’t	told	me
beforehand	 because	 he	 didn’t	 want	 me	 to	 be	 intimidated.	 At	 that	 moment,	 I
should	have	felt	the	spark	and	thought,	“Hey,	maybe	I	can	do	this.”	But	I	didn’t.
I	still	didn’t	see	myself	having	a	career	as	a	tennis	pro.

**When	did	you	give	up	on	tennis?**

In	university,	I	injured	my	ankle	playing	football	[soccer].	My	tennis	coach	told
me	to	take	the	winter	off	and	come	back,	but	I	never	did.

**Is	there	anything	about	your	experience	playing	tennis	at	a	serious	level	that
relates	to	your	trading	career?**

In	tennis,	you	must	take	every	shot,	whereas,	in	trading,	you	don’t	have	to	take
every	potential	trade.	You	can	wait	for	a	trade	where	everything	lines	up	in	your
favor.	It	would	be	like	playing	tennis	and	only	having	to	take	the	shot	when	you
were	set	up	for	a	perfect	smash.	One	thing	I	realized	about	trading	is	that	I	don’t
have	to	trade	if	I	am	not	in	the	right	frame	of	mind	or	the	opportunity	cycle	is	not
in	line	with	the	way	I	trade,	and	I	quite	like	that.

**That	is	more	an	observation	about	the	contrast	between	playing	tennis	and
trading.	Is	there	any	connection	between	reaching	a	high	level	of	proficiency
in	a	sport	like	tennis	and	being	a	skilled	trader?**

It	comes	down	to	the	psychological	similarities	between	excelling	in	a	sport	and
trading.	You	need	to	have	discipline	in	both.	You	need	to	manage	your	rest	and


nutrition.	As	a	trader,	you	need	to	make	optimal	decisions,	and	it’s	difficult	to
make	the	right	decision	if	you’re	stressed	or	tired.

**What	sparked	your	interest	in	the	markets?**

When	I	was	in	university,	the	markets	were	a	big	part	of	what	was	going	on	in
the	news.

**What	years	are	we	talking	about?**

2008	to	2010.

**Oh,	the	financial	meltdown	and	its	aftermath.	What	did	you	major	in?**

Economics	 and	 finance.	 I	 felt	 that	 finance	 was	 an	 exciting	 field.	 I	 liked	 not
knowing	what	would	happen	the	next	day.	I	didn’t	want	to	be	in	a	mundane	job.

**When	did	you	start	trading?**

While	I	was	in	university,	I	started	spread	betting	on	currencies.	I	think	it	is
illegal	in	the	US,	but	it	is	legal	in	the	UK	and	also	tax-free.

**How	much	were	you	betting?**

Tiny	amounts—only	a	few	pounds.	I	didn’t	have	much	money.

**On	what	basis	were	you	placing	bets?**

I	was	just	using	basic	technical	analysis,	such	as	chart	breakouts	and	moving
averages.

**What	did	you	learn	during	that	phase?**

I	made	5k	and	then	lost	2k	very	quickly.	I	realized	I	didn’t	know	what	I	was
doing.	I	decided	to	bank	my	remaining	gains	and	focus	on	my	studies.	Going
into	my	last	year,	my	grades	weren’t	that	great.	I	wanted	to	get	a	job	as	a	trader
when	I	graduated,	and	I	realized	that	I	needed	to	improve	my	grades	if	I	was
going	to	get	into	the	field.	I	studied	hard	in	my	final	year	and	managed	to	get	a
good	grade	overall.

One	day,	someone	from	one	of	the	banks	came	down	to	our	university	to	give	a
talk.	His	topic	was	primarily	about	the	operations	department.	After	the	talk,	I
went	up	to	him	and	said,	“I	really	would	like	to	get	a	job	trading.	How	can	I	do
it?”	He	 replied,	“To	 be	 honest,	there	 are	probably	 200	 jobs	in	 the	 operations
department	and	less	than	half	a	dozen	in	the	trading	department,	and	the	trading
jobs	are	only	going	to	go	to	candidates	from	top-tier	universities.”

**I	take	it	that	you	were	not	at	a	top	university.**

No,	it	was	a	mid-level	university.

**What	did	you	do	then?**


At	that	point,	I	thought	I	might	as	well	try	to	apply	for	as	many	trading	positions
as	I	could	anyway.	I	felt	if	I	could	just	get	an	interview,	then	maybe	I	could	sell
myself.	I	applied	to	about	30	different	places,	mostly	banks,	but	also	proprietary
trading	firms.	I	was	rejected	by	all	of	them	except	for	one	proprietary	trading
firm	that	gave	me	an	interview.

**Tell	me	about	that	interview.**

I	was	interviewed	by	the	risk	manager	who	had	been	a	floor	trader	before	he
decided	 to	 switch	 from	 trading	 to	 management.	 I	 had	 just	 finished	 my	 final
exams,	and	it	was	the	only	interview	I	had.	I	was	determined	to	do	well.

**Were	there	any	pivotal	questions	or	answers	in	the	interview?**

We	just	had	a	long	conversation	about	what	was	going	on	in	the	markets	at	the
time.	 I	 think	 he	 was	 impressed	 with	 my	 genuine	 interest	 in	 the	 markets	 and
desire	to	learn.	At	the	end,	he	asked	me	if	there	was	anything	else	I	wanted	to
ask	for	or	say.	I	told	him,	“I	have	applied	to	30	different	places,	and	I	 _really_ 	want
to	be	in	this	field.	If	you	just	give	me	this	job,	I	will	be	the	hardest	worker	you
will	ever	see.”	I	think	it	was	my	enthusiasm	more	than	anything	else	that	got	me
the	job.

**Tell	me	about	your	experience	when	you	joined	the	trading	firm.**

The	 first	 three	 months	 were	 a	 big	 learning	 curve.	 They	 taught	 us	 about	 both
fundamental	analysis	and	technical	analysis	in	classroom	sessions.

**Did	you	have	a	methodology	when	you	started	trading?**

In	the	beginning,	I	was	just	testing	things	out.	I	didn’t	have	much	of	a	process.
Initially,	I	gravitated	more	toward	technical	analysis.	I	used	Market	Profile	[a
type	of	price	analysis	that	attaches	particular	significance	to	the	price	areas	that
witnessed	large	trading	volumes]	and	combined	it	with	chart	analysis.	I	didn’t
like	indicators;	I	thought	they	were	backward-looking.	Whereas,	I	quite	liked
chart	patterns	because	they	would	tell	you	where	you	were	and	give	you	some
context	for	what	to	expect.	For	example,	if	the	market	was	in	a	trading	range,
you	knew	that	eventually	there	had	to	be	a	breakout	in	one	direction,	even	if	that
breakout	proved	to	be	a	false	breakout.

**I	agree.	After	all,	indicators	are	derivatives	of	price	and,	therefore,	can’t
give	you	more	information	than	already	exists	in	the	price	chart	itself.**

**Looking	at	your	track	record,	I	noted	that	you	were	profitable	pretty	much
straight	off	the	bat.	Apparently,	you	were	doing	quite	well	with	technical
analysis,	 since	 that	 is	 the	 approach	 you	 started	 with.	 I	 wonder	 what**


**motivated	you	to	switch	from	technical	analysis	to	fundamental	analysis,
given	that	you	were	trading	profitably	using	technical	analysis?**

I	felt	uncomfortable	with	technical	analysis	because	I	didn’t	understand	why	it
should	 work,	 and,	 consequently,	 I	 didn’t	 have	 the	 confidence	 that	 it	 would
continue	to	work	in	the	future.	Whereas	with	fundamentals,	I	had	a	much	clearer
understanding	 of	 why	 prices	 moved	 from	 one	 level	 to	 another.	 I	 also	 found
fundamental	analysis	way	more	interesting.	Actually,	reading	your	first	 _Market
Wizards_ 	book	was	a	formative	influence	in	my	early	career.	I	don’t	remember
who	said	it,	but	the	advice	to	trade	a	method	in	line	with	your	personality	had	a
significant	impact	on	me.

**I	don’t	remember	who	said	it	either	because	that	same	message	came	up
either	explicitly	or	implicitly	in	multiple	interviews.	When	I	give	talks	about
the	lessons	of	the	** **_Market	Wizards_** **,	the	importance	of	trading	an	approach
compatible	with	your	personality	is	one	of	the	first	points	I	tend	to	stress.
How	did	you	start	using	fundamental	analysis	as	a	trading	tool?**

It	was	mainly	headline	trading—typically,	trading	on	the	comments	of	central
bankers	or	other	officials.

**How	did	you	trade	those	headlines?**

I	had	a	view	of	what	the	market	was	expecting	for	any	event	based	on	reading
various	comments	and	news	stories.	Back	then,	I	would	trade	headlines	based	on
whether	they	were	bullish	or	bearish	relative	to	market	expectations,	even	trades
in	which	it	didn’t	seem	to	make	any	sense	to	expect	a	market	response	because
the	information	was	already	out	there.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example?**

The	point	at	which	I	really	started	building	my	account	was	during	the	eurozone
debt	crisis	in	2011.	That	was	the	time	when	Greece	began	blowing	up.	Every
day,	you	would	see	a	headline	referencing	a	comment	by	European	officials	that
was	either	hawkish	or	dovish	towards	Greece.	I	would	trade	these	comments	for
short-term	moves	in	the	euro.	At	one	point,	I	noticed	that	an	official	could	say
something	like,	“We’re	not	going	to	help	Greece,”	and	the	euro	would	move	20
ticks.	Then	later	in	the	day,	Chancellor	Merkel	would	come	out	and	say	the	same
thing,	 and	 the	 euro	 would	 move	 another	 40	 ticks.	 You	 would	 think	 that	 the
information	was	already	in	the	market,	so	there	shouldn’t	be	any	price	reaction.
But	 I	 would	 trade	 it	 because	 the	 market	 suggested	 that	 information	 was	 now
more	significant	since	Merkel	said	it.	I	didn’t	care	whether	I	fully	understood	the
reasons	behind	it;	all	I	cared	about	was	the	immediate	market	impact.	I	try	to


align	 myself	 more	 with	 making	 money	 than	 being	 intellectually	 correct.	 In
practice,	that	means	letting	the	market	reaction	to	news	guide	me	as	to	what	is
important.

**Before,	you	used	the	phrase,	“back	then,”	implying	that	you	no	longer	trade
the	fundamentals	the	same	way.	How	has	your	approach	changed?**

Actually,	what	I	do	now	is	quite	the	opposite.	I	will	fade	the	initial	reactions	to
headlines.	It	is	no	longer	possible	to	trade	for	the	initial	move	off	the	headline
because	 the	 algos	 will	 make	 the	 trade	 before	 I	 can.	 [Dhaliwal	 is	 referring	 to
algorithmic	programs	that	are	designed	to	instantaneously	take	trades	based	on
the	words	and	phrases	in	news	headlines.]

**It	sounds	like	these	headline-based	trades,	whether	trading	in	the	direction
of	the	headlines,	as	you	did	in	your	earlier	years,	or	fading	them	as	you	did
subsequently,	were	all	very	short-term	trades.	When	did	you	start	taking
longer-term	trades?**

Around	2016,	I	began	to	realize	that	when	there	was	a	significant	fundamental
shift,	the	short-term	moves	continued	into	longer-term	moves.	Then	I	thought,
“Why	am	I	spending	all	my	time	trying	to	catch	the	short-term	moves	when	I
can	just	nail	one	of	these	big	moves	and	make	a	significant	portion	of	my	annual
profits	in	just	one	trade?”	That’s	when	my	trading	mentality	shifted.	I	thought,	“I
don’t	have	to	be	right	all	the	time;	I	just	need	to	be	right	in	a	big	way	a	few	times
a	year.”	It’s	not	an	easy	game	trying	to	trade	headlines.	Mentally,	it’s	quite	tiring.
Then,	when	I	analyzed	my	trading	results,	I	noted	that	almost	all	my	profits	were
coming	from	very	few	trades,	which	meant	that	all	the	other	trades	were	netting
out	to	close	to	zero.	So	why	was	I	bothering	to	take	all	those	trades?

**What	was	the	essential	distinction	between	the	trades	contributing	to	your
P&L	and	those	that	weren’t?**

The	most	profitable	trades	were	the	ones	that	were	based	on	entirely	unexpected
events.

**So	 was	 the	 change	 in	 your	 approach	 basically	 a	 matter	 of	 being	 more
restrictive	in	the	trades	you	took	and	having	a	willingness	to	hold	those
trades	longer?**

Not	 entirely.	 The	 major	 shift	 was	 a	 transition	 to	 trades	 that	 were	 based	 on	 a
broader	macroeconomic	analysis.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example?**

This	past	July	[2019],	I	went	short	the	S&P	in	what	was	probably	my	largest


trade	 ever.	 I	 felt	 the	 policymakers	 weren’t	 doing	 enough	 to	 alleviate	 the
downside	risks	in	the	economy.	Payroll	growth	and	manufacturing	were	slowing.
At	 the	 same	 time,	 EU	 economic	 data	 was	 terrible.	 Based	 on	 my	 historical
analogue	models,	I	felt	that	given	the	economic	regime	we	were	in,	the	equity
market	was	susceptible	to	a	drawdown.

**Where	exactly	did	you	go	short?**

[Dhaliwal	shows	me	the	chart	pointing	to	a	narrow	consolidation	forming	near
the	top	of	a	broader	range	near	all-time	highs.]

**Of	course,	with	the	benefit	of	hindsight,	the	market	subsequently	broke
back	 down	 towards	 the	 lower	 end	 of	 the	 range,	 but,	 at	 the	 time,	 a
consolidation	near	all-time	highs	is	a	type	of	pattern	that	could	easily	have
led	to	another	upswing.	What	would	have	happened	if	the	market	started
rallying	 into	 new	 highs?	 How	 much	 room	 would	 you	 have	 given	 the
market?**

Not	 a	 lot	 because	 I	 was	 timing	 the	 market	 based	 on	 some	 of	 my	 short-term
fundamental	indicators.	Also,	I	split	the	trade	between	outright	shorts	in	the	S&P
and	long	S&P	puts.	I	gave	the	puts	more	breathing	room.

**When	a	market	trades	in	a	wide	range	on	the	same	fundamentals,	as	the
S&P	did,	how	do	you	decide	when	to	initiate	the	trade?	I	assume	that	your
stop	would	have	been	considerably	narrower	than	the	market	range.**

I	wouldn’t	sell	the	S&P	in	no	man’s	land.	The	entry	would	be	more	towards	the
top	of	the	range.

**That	is	what	I	was	grappling	with.	So,	if	you	have	a	bearish	view	and	the
market	is	in	a	wide	range,	then	when	the	market	gets	to	the	top	of	the	range,
where	it	is	unclear	whether	it	will	fail	or	break	out	to	new	highs,	you	would
be	inclined	to	trade	from	the	short	side	because	your	fundamental	models
suggest	that	a	failure	is	more	likely.	Is	that	a	fair	description	of	how	you
might	determine	the	timing	of	a	trade	based	on	fundamentals?**

Yes,	with	the	proviso	that	if	there	is	a	significant	development,	it	doesn’t	matter
where	the	market	is	within	the	range.

**I	assume	by	“significant	development,”	you	are	referring	to	a	headline	event
whose	impact	is	likely	to	be	long-lasting.	But	that	raises	the	question:	What
if	 such	 an	 event’s	 implications	 are	 contrary	 to	 your	 fundamental
expectations?**

I	would	go	with	the	event	if	it	were	big	enough.	I	want	to	make	money	more


than	 I	 want	 to	 be	 right.	 Also,	 I	 am	 not	 looking	 for	 confirming	 signals;	 I	 am
looking	for	disconfirming	signals.	All	I	care	about	is	how	I	might	be	wrong.	If
there	is	a	meaningful	adverse	event,	it	might	mean	my	models	are	wrong.

_Several	weeks	after	our	interview,	the	S&P	500	broke	out	to	new	highs	and
staged	a	large	advance	in	the	ensuing	months.	This	price	action	prompted	a
follow-up	Q&A	via	email._

**All	the	economic	reasons	you	mentioned	for	being	short	the	S&P	during	our
interview	would	seemingly	also	have	applied	in	Q4	when	the	market	went
straight	up.	I	don’t	understand	why	the	same	fundamentals	wouldn’t	have
dictated	a	bearish	stance	in	Q4	when	such	a	trading	position	would	have
been	dead	wrong.	What	were	the	differences	between	when	you	put	on	the
trade	[late	July	2019]	and	Q4	that	would	have	kept	you	off	the	short	side	in
Q4?**

My	 outlook	 for	 some	 key	 economic	 indicators	 for	 Q4	 was	 indeed	 bearish.
However,	in	that	quarter,	the	Fed	changed	its	policy	stance	and	switched	on	the
liquidity	taps.	My	research	suggested	their	actions	would	outweigh	my	reasons
for	being	bearish	at	the	time	(deteriorating	economic	data).	So,	I	stayed	on	the
sidelines	for	most	of	that	period.

**What	was	your	most	painful	trade?**

In	December	2015,	there	was	a	big	ECB	[European	Central	Bank]	meeting.	The
expectation	going	into	this	meeting	was	that	the	ECB	would	cut	rates	and	do
quantitative	 easing.	 I	 did	 my	 fundamental	 analysis	 beforehand	 and	 was	 fully
prepared.	I	knew	what	the	market	expected	and	what	would	and	would	not	be	a
trade.	We	were	all	sitting	in	the	office	waiting	for	the	news.	About	five	or	ten
minutes	before	the	official	announcement	was	expected,	a	headline	came	over
the	 Bloomberg	 from	 the	 _FT_ [ _Financial	 Times_ ]	 saying,	 “ECB	 leaves	 rates
unchanged	in	shock	decision.”	I	saw	the	attribution	to	the	 _FT_ ,	and	I	thought	it
had	to	be	correct.	The	story	was	such	a	complete	surprise	that	I	thought	I	could
have	my	best	day	ever	if	it	was	correct.	I	decided	to	take	a	punt	and	instantly
started	buying	the	euro	and	selling	the	Euro	Stoxx	50.	The	story	was	wrong.	The
ECB	cut	rates.	The	markets	reversed	so	quickly	that	even	though	I	liquidated


immediately,	I	ended	up	getting	out	at	the	extreme	of	those	moves.	I	went	from
being	up	six	figures	to	down	six	figures	in	a	matter	of	seconds.

**So,	initially,	the	market	did	move	in	your	direction.**

Yes,	because	the	markets	started	moving	on	the	 _FT_ 	headline,	but	when	the	actual
announcement	came	out,	they	instantly	reversed.

**How	large	was	the	percentage	loss	in	your	account	due	to	that	trade?**

About	20%.

**Was	there	any	lesson	in	that	trade?**

Yes,	once	it	was	over,	I	said,	“I’m	never	going	to	let	that	happen	again.”

**What	exactly	do	you	mean	by	“that”?**

To	have	a	large	position	on	and	not	have	a	stop	in.

**Why	didn’t	you	have	a	stop?**

Because	I	was	so	far	ahead,	I	didn’t	think	it	would	come	all	the	way	back.

**Was	that	trade	the	point	of	demarcation	after	which	you	always	had	a	stop
in?**

Not	only	that	but	after	that	trade,	I	also	made	sure	that	I	took	some	money	off	the
table	when	I	had	a	quick,	large	gain.	The	euro	had	already	moved	a	full	percent
before	the	ECB	announcement	came	out,	and	I	still	had	my	entire	position	on.

**So	is	it	fair	to	say	that	two	things	changed	in	your	trading	after	that	trade:
You	always	have	a	stop	in,	and	you	take	partial	profits	when	possible?**

Exactly.	 Trading	 is	 so	 much	 about	 keeping	 the	 downside	 small.	 The
psychological	impact	of	large	drawdowns	is	not	worth	the	upside.	You	are	much
better	off	keeping	an	even	keel.

**So	what	was	the	story	with	that	** **_Financial	Times_** **	article?**

To	 this	 day,	 I	 don’t	 know.	 The	 thing	 is	 that	 I	 would	 never	 have	 traded	 on
something	like	that	if	it	wasn’t	the	 _FT_ .	In	hindsight,	the	story	should	have	been
implausible	because	the	press	is	in	a	lockup	room	and	cannot	release	any	article
until	the	precise	time	of	the	actual	announcement.

I	 later	 found	 the	 explanation	 of	 what	 happened	 in	 a	 retraction	 issued	 by	 the
_Financial	Times_.

```
On	Thursday,	we	published	an	incorrect	story	on	FT.com	 that	 stated	 the
```

```
European	Central	Bank	had	confounded	expectations	by	deciding	to	hold
interest	rates	rather	than	cut	them.	The	story	was	published	a	few	minutes
before	the	decision	to	cut	rates	was	announced.	The	story	was	wrong	and
should	 not	 have	 been	 published.	 The	 article	 was	 one	 of	 two	 pre-written
stories—covering	different	possible	decisions—which	had	been	prepared	in
advance	 of	 the	 announcement.	 Due	 to	 an	 editing	 error	 it	 was	 published
when	it	should	not	have	been.	Automated	feeds	meant	that	the	initial	error
was	 compounded	 by	 being	 simultaneously	 published	 on	 Twitter.	 The	 FT
deeply	regrets	this	serious	mistake	and	will	immediately	be	reviewing	its
publication	and	workflow	processes	to	ensure	such	an	error	cannot	happen
again.	We	apologise	to	all	our	readers.
```
**I	found	you	through	Steve	Goldstein	[the	founder	of	Alpha	R	Cubed,	a
London-based	 executive	 coaching	 firm,	 who	 has	 worked	 with	 many
excellent	traders].	You	have	done	so	extraordinarily	well.	What	was	your
motivation	in	seeking	a	trading	coach?**

Peter	Brandt	says,	“Successful	market	speculation	is	an	upstream	swim	against
human	nature,”	and	I	liken	coaching	to	a	speedboat	that	helps	me	do	that.	I	felt	I
needed	an	external	check	on	my	own	trading,	particularly	when	I	was	not	trading
my	best	or	the	opportunity	set	was	not	in	line	with	my	trading	style,	and	Steve
plays	that	role.	At	those	times,	I	find	it	helpful	to	talk	to	Steve	to	prevent	myself
from	going	into	a	deeper	drawdown.	Additionally,	working	with	Steve	helped
me	clarify	and	solidify	my	trading	rules.	He	also	helped	me	realize	that	I	was	too
focused	on	my	weaknesses	and	that	I	needed	to	focus	more	on	my	strengths.	If
you	focus	on	your	strengths,	you	don’t	leave	any	time	for	your	weaknesses.

**I	know	from	Steve	that	you	bid	in	a	charity	auction	to	have	lunch	with	Ray
Dalio.	Tell	me	about	that	experience.**

I	read	a	 _Business	Insider_ 	article	that	mentioned	that	Ray	Dalio	was	offering	a
lunch	meeting	for	a	charity	auction.	I	thought,	“That	sounds	really	cool,	but	I	bet
that	the	winning	bid	is	going	to	be	something	like	$1	million.”	I	checked	the
website	and	discovered	that	the	bidding	was	only	in	the	low-digit	thousands.	I
thought,	“I	would	love	to	meet	him.	I’m	going	to	go	for	it!”	I	started	bidding,
and	to	my	surprise,	I	was	actually	the	leading	bidder	for	quite	a	while—in	fact,	I
still	had	the	leading	bid	on	the	final	day	of	the	auction.	I	left	work	that	day	and
took	the	train	home,	hoping	I	could	get	back	quickly.	The	timing	was	running


very	tight	with	the	close	of	the	auction,	and	as	soon	as	I	got	out	of	the	train
station,	I	checked	the	website	to	see	if	I	was	still	winning.	I	saw	that	I	had	lost
the	bid.	I	was	devastated.	I	castigated	myself	thinking,	“Why	did	I	get	on	the
train?	I	should	have	waited	a	bit	longer.”	The	next	day	I	received	an	email	from
Charitybuzz,	the	website	that	had	run	the	auction,	saying	that	Dalio	was	offering
a	second	lunch	and	that	I	could	have	it	if	I	matched	the	winning	bid,	which	I
happily	did.

**What	was	the	winning	bid?**

The	winning	bid	was	only	$40,000.

**Where	did	you	have	lunch?**

It	was	an	Italian	restaurant	in	the	West	Village	[Manhattan].	I	don’t	remember
the	name.

**How	was	the	lunch?**

Amazing.	Ray	Dalio’s	book,	 _Principles_ ,	had	a	significant	impact	on	me	and	not
only	changed	the	way	I	thought	about	trading	but	also	about	life.

**In	what	way?**

After	 reading	 _Principles_ ,	 I	 started	 questioning	 everything.	 I	 think	 what	 Dalio
was	saying	in	that	book	is	that	your	perception	of	reality	is	not	necessarily	the
way	things	are.	To	reach	your	goals,	you	need	a	strong	understanding	of	the	links
between	the	actions	you	take	and	the	outcomes	they	produce	over	time.	You	can
then	 adjust	 your	 actions	 where	 needed	 to	 reach	 the	 desired	 outcomes.	 That
message	prompted	me	to	start	doing	data	analysis	on	my	trades.

**What	did	you	learn	from	that	exercise?**

I	reviewed	the	trading	notes	I	kept,	which	represented	my	perceptions,	and	then	I
looked	at	the	data	of	the	outcomes	for	those	trades,	which	represented	the	reality.
One	realization	that	came	out	of	that	review	was	that	although	I	thought	I	was
good	at	technical	analysis,	I	discovered	that	I	really	wasn’t.

**Did	that	insight	change	your	trading?**

It	did.	I	started	ditching	technical	analysis.

**How	did	the	conversation	proceed	at	lunch?**

Dalio	said,	“This	is	your	time.	Ask	anything	you	want.”

**So	what	was	the	first	thing	you	asked?**

I	was	quite	nervous.	It’s	a	bit	of	a	blur	looking	back	at	it	now.	I	told	Dalio	that	I
wanted	to	talk	about	my	trading,	markets,	and	his	views	on	life.


**Did	he	give	you	any	specific	advice?**

He	told	me	it	was	essential	to	go	as	far	back	as	I	could	to	test	my	views.	Dalio	is
a	master	of	history.	He	said	that	people	get	blindsided	by	something	that	has
happened	 before	 because	 they	 overweight	 recent	 history	 and	 their	 own
experience	and	don’t	go	back	far	enough	to	backtest	their	views.	He	helped	me
understand	that	to	get	conviction,	you	have	to	look	at	history	well	beyond	your
own	experience.

**So	now,	when	you	analyze	markets,	how	far	back	do	you	go?**

As	far	as	I	can.

**Which	means	what?**

At	 the	 moment,	 about	 100	 years—but,	 ideally,	 I	 would	 like	 to	 go	 back	 well
beyond	that.	Reading	is	part	of	my	research.	One	book	that	I	read	recently	is
_Devil	 Take	 the	 Hindmost:	 A	 History	 of	 Financial	 Speculation_ by	 Edward
Chancellor.	 That	 book	 talks	 about	 market	 bubbles	 going	 all	 the	 way	 back	 to
tulipmania.

**Is	that	a	good	book?**

It’s	fantastic.	It’s	a	book	that	can	help	you	develop	the	kind	of	broader	historical
perspective	of	markets	and	speculation	that	Dalio	talks	about.

**Were	there	any	other	insights	that	you	got	from	your	lunch	with	Dalio?**

It	was	valuable	to	understand	how	Dalio	thought	about	expected	value.	I	don’t
want	to	misquote	him	here,	but	as	a	rough	paraphrase,	he	talked	about	all	the
focus	and	expenditures	on	space	exploration	as	the	big	frontier.	Dalio	thought
about	it	the	opposite	way—namely	that	we	should	go	down	into	the	ocean,	given
the	ocean	depths	are	still	largely	unexplored.	He	framed	the	argument	in	terms	of
expected	value.	He	said	we	could	learn	much	more	from	ocean	exploration	than
we	could	by	spending	the	same	amount	on	space	exploration.	In	other	words,	the
expected	 value	 from	 ocean	 exploration	 was	 much	 greater	 than	 the	 expected
value	from	space	exploration.	I	found	Dalio’s	perspective	fascinating.	I	started
thinking	about	how	I	could	identify	expected	value	in	markets.

**How	would	you	define	expected	value?**

For	me,	it’s	having	a	contrarian	view	on	a	market	that	is	very	out-of-favor.	For
example,	earlier	this	year	[2019],	corn	was	extremely	out-of-favor.	Prices	were
at	their	lowest	levels	in	decades,	and	the	speculative	short	position	was	larger
than	it	had	been	for	a	very	long	time.	That	type	of	situation	suggests	there	is	a
high	expected	value	in	being	on	the	other	side	of	the	market,	provided	there	is	a


sufficient	fundamental	shift	to	support	that	stance.

**Were	you	able	to	eat	anything	at	this	lunch?**

[He	 laughs.]	 Dalio	 was	 saying,	 “Hey,	 you	 should	 taste	 this;	 it	 is	 really	 very
good.”	I	realized	that,	at	that	point,	I	hadn’t	eaten	anything	yet.

**Were	 there	 any	 other	 people	 that	 were	 influential	 in	 developing	 your
trading	methodology?**

Yes,	 Peter	 Brandt.	 [Brandt	 was	 interviewed	 in	 Chapter	 1.]	 I	 have	 been	 a
subscriber	to	Brandt’s	 _Factor_ 	trading	service	for	a	long	time.	I	heard	he	was
coming	to	Poland,	and	I	really	wanted	to	meet	him.	I	emailed	his	assistant	and
arranged	to	meet	Peter	there.	I	ended	up	having	dinner	and	breakfast	with	him.
Peter	is	so	humble	about	his	trading.	He	is	one	of	those	people	who	understands
what	he	knows	and	sticks	to	his	edge.	Peter	told	me	that	it	took	him	8	to	10	years
before	he	knew	he	had	a	definable	edge.	The	fact	that	it	took	him	that	long	really
struck	me.	I	realized	I	had	a	lot	more	work	to	do	before	I	understood	what	my
edge	 really	 was.	 After	 our	 meeting,	 I	 decided	 I	 needed	 to	 examine	 the
characteristics	of	my	big	wins	because	I	have	a	large	skew	in	my	trades.	I	looked
at	 everything	 related	 to	 those	 trades:	 my	 feelings	 at	 the	 time,	 the	 prevailing
market	 characteristics,	 and	 my	 market	 analysis.	 I	 was	 looking	 for	 common
denominators	in	those	trades	in	which	I	did	very	well.

**You	had	all	that	information	on	all	your	trades?**

I	have	been	maintaining	a	daily	trading	journal	since	2011.

**And	Peter	was	the	inspiration	for	going	through	your	notes	to	examine	the
characteristics	of	your	big	winners?**

Yes,	definitely.	Peter	writes	an	annual	review	of	what	he	calls	his	“best-dressed
trades,”	which	are	the	trades	that	provided	the	clearest	examples	of	the	classic
chart	patterns	he	looks	for	and	subsequently	led	to	the	price	moves	implied	by
those	patterns.

**So,	you	wanted	to	find	out	what	your	“best-dressed	trades”	looked	like.**

Yes,	exactly.

**What	did	you	find?**

I	realized	an	unexpected	event	that	ran	counter	to	the	news	flow	was	present	in
every	one	of	my	big	winning	trades.	Another	characteristic	of	these	trades	was
that	my	reason	for	entering	was	very	clear;	I	didn’t	confuse	my	short-term	and
long-term	views.	I	also	noticed	that	these	trades	were	never	down	by	much	and
usually	 tended	 to	 be	 profitable	 almost	 immediately,	 whereas	 the	 trades	 that


didn’t	work	tended	to	go	offside	quickly	and	stay	offside.

**You	mentioned	that	you	record	your	feelings	in	your	daily	trading	journal.
Can	you	give	me	a	specific	example	of	how	having	that	type	of	information
helped	you	improve	as	a	trader?**

I	think	the	behavioral	side	of	trading	is	an	underexplored	area	for	improving
performance.	 Certain	 feelings	 are	 symptomatic	 of	 trading-related	 issues.	 For
example,	there	was	a	short	period	when	I	was	consistently	recording	feelings	of
frustration	and	FOMO	[fear	of	missing	out]	in	my	journal.	When	I	delved	into	it,
I	 discovered	 that	 the	 underlying	 cause	 of	 this	 emotional	 disharmony	 was	 a
conflict	between	my	short-term	and	long-term	views.	What	was	happening	was
that	I	would	have	a	longer-term	trade	on,	but	then	I	would	see	a	chance	to	make
money	on	an	opposite,	shorter-term	bet	in	the	same	market.	I	would	then	end	up
trading	neither	view	effectively.	Even	worse,	I	was	leaving	significant	profits	on
the	table,	which	was	the	source	of	my	frustration.	I	realized	this	conflict	was
happening	because,	at	the	time,	I	was	transitioning	my	approach	to	taking	more
longer-term	trades.	Once	I	objectively	understood	the	issue,	I	could	then	develop
the	right	solution.

**What	was	the	solution?**

I	would	anticipate	possible	short-term	trades	that	would	run	counter	to	my	long-
term	view	in	a	particular	market,	and	if	they	developed	as	expected,	I	would
trade	them	for	what	they	were,	but	I	would	leave	my	long-term	trade	on.

**Is	there	anything	else	that	you	learned	from	Brandt?**

Yes,	he	talks	about	“leakage,”	which	is	money	that	you	lose	on	trades	that	are
not	fully	aligned	with	your	process.	I	started	tracking	those	types	of	trades	in	my
account	 and	 saw	 that	 they	 were	 holding	 me	 back	 from	 reaching	 even	 higher
levels	of	profits.	In	2017,	all	my	profits	came	from	10%	of	my	trading	days.	It’s
so	 critical	 to	 avoid	 marginal	 trades	 because	 they	 waste	 monetary	 and
psychological	capital.

**Peter’s	 trading	 approach	 is	 100%	 chart-based,	 whereas	 your	 trading	 is
driven	by	fundamentals.	Is	his	influence	entirely	a	matter	of	broad	trading
principles	 independent	 of	 methodology,	 such	 as	 knowing	 your	 edge,
avoiding	suboptimal	trades,	and	risk	management,	or	is	any	part	of	his
approach	applicable	to	your	trading?**

I	do	use	Peter’s	charting	principles	because	I	think	the	way	he	looks	at	markets	is
timeless.	He	doesn’t	use	indicators	and	only	looks	at	charts,	a	perspective	that
resonates	with	the	way	I	look	at	markets	as	well.


**I	take	it	then	that	the	broad	price	picture	can	influence	your	trading.**

It	can.	I	believe	that	long-term	chart	patterns	are	important,	especially	prolonged
consolidations.	You	can’t	tell	when	they	will	break,	but	when	they	do,	it	can
often	lead	to	major	price	moves.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	a	trade	where	the	chart	price	action	was	a
significant	element?**

One	trade	immediately	comes	to	mind	because	it	is	such	a	classic	example.	It
goes	back	quite	a	while,	though.

**That	doesn’t	make	any	difference;	it’s	the	example	that	counts.**

In	early	May	2013,	the	Australian	dollar	had	been	in	a	trading	consolidation	for
a	long	time.	On	this	day	[he	points	to	May	9,	2013	on	the	price	chart],	you	had
one	 of	 those	 disconfirming	 days	 where	 the	 economic	 data,	 an	 employment
report,	was	very	strong,	but	the	market	broke	out	on	the	downside	of	its	long-
term	range.	The	employment	report	was	not	just	bullish,	but	 _really_ 	bullish.	The
market	had	expected	an	11,000	figure,	and	the	number	came	in	at	50,000.	Also,
the	unemployment	rate	went	down,	while	the	participation	rate	went	up.	The
report	was	bullish	in	every	possible	way.	The	data	came	out	2:30	in	the	morning
European	time.	There	was	an	initial	rally	on	the	report,	but	by	the	time	I	got	into
the	office	at	7	a.m.,	the	market	had	already	sold	off,	with	prices	trading	below
the	long-running	consolidation	pattern	that	I	had	been	watching.	I	saw	the	data
that	 had	 come	 out	 and	 the	 subsequent	 price	 action,	 and,	 straightaway,	 I	 just
started	selling.	I	didn’t	think;	I	just	went	short	immediately.

**Do	you	do	anything	differently	when	you	are	in	a	losing	period?**

I	have	a	systematic	process	for	cutting	my	size	down	when	I	am	in	a	drawdown.
I	consider	any	loss	less	than	5%	to	be	just	the	natural	fluctuation	required	to
generate	my	returns.	But	once	a	drawdown	exceeds	5%,	I	cut	my	size	in	half.

**Is	there	a	point	at	which	you	cut	it	even	further?**

If	the	drawdown	exceeds	8%,	I	cut	my	size	by	half	again,	and	if	it	reaches	15%,	I
would	stop	trading	and	take	a	break.

**Has	that	ever	happened?**

Aside	from	that	one	day	with	the	erroneous	 _Financial	Times_ 	story,	there	was	one
other	instance.	I	basically	came	to	work,	did	research,	and	didn’t	trade.

**How	long	did	that	last?**

Not	that	long—about	a	week	or	two.

**We	talked	about	the	lessons	you	learned	from	Ray	Dalio	and	Peter	Brandt.**


**Were	there	any	lessons	you	learned	from	other	traders?**

From	my	former	bosses,	I	learned	that	trading	is	not	about	being	right;	it’s	about
making	money.	People	are	often	preoccupied	with	being	intellectually	correct,
which	can	be	a	hindrance	to	making	money.	When	I	started,	my	attitude	was	that
I	didn’t	know	anything.	So,	I	always	worked	backward	from	the	market	moves
rather	than	forward	from	personal	opinions.	I	wouldn’t	think,	“I	have	a	view	on
how	Greece	is	going	to	negotiate	with	Europe,	and,	therefore,	the	market	will
move	in	this	way.”	Instead,	I	would	look	at	market	moves	and	then	backtrack	to
why	they	moved	the	way	they	did.	For	example,	if	EU	officials	made	a	statement
and	the	market	reacted,	I	would	interpret	it	as,	“Oh,	they	said	that,	and	that’s
why	the	market	had	that	move.”

**What	advice	would	you	give	other	traders	about	how	they	can	improve?**

Compile	your	trading	statistics	and	maintain	a	trading	journal.	Armed	with	this
information,	 you	 should	 be	 able	 to	 define	 your	 positive	 and	 negative	 edge
characteristics	and	adjust	your	trading	accordingly.	Stay	in	the	sphere	of	your
edge	 by	 playing	 your	 game	 and	 not	 someone	 else’s.	 Then,	 visualize	 yourself
trading	at	your	best.	What	does	that	look	like?	What	things	aren’t	you	doing	that
you	 should	 be?	 What	 actions	 do	 you	 need	 to	 guard	 against?	 Through	 this
process,	you	can	enhance	your	positive	edge	and	limit	your	negative	tendencies.

**What	are	the	trading	rules	you	live	by?**

It’s	interesting,	in	the	beginning,	a	lot	of	my	rules	and	principles	came	from	what
the	traders	in	your	 _Market	Wizards_ 	book	said.	Over	time,	these	rules	changed	to
fit	my	personality	and	what	worked	for	me.	These	are	the	rules	I	have	now:

```
To	paraphrase	Adam	Robinson,	genius	is	knowing	that	you	have	a	hammer
and	only	looking	for	nails.	The	point	is	that	I	need	to	stick	with	what	I	do
well.
The	risk/reward	on	a	trade	is	quite	dynamic	and	can	change	dramatically	as
you	hold	it.	Therefore,	I	need	to	be	flexible	in	covering	part	of	my	position
as	a	trade	moves	in	my	favor.	Otherwise,	I	am	implicitly	assuming	that	I’m
going	to	be	100%	right.	I	learned	this	rule	through	multiple	experiences	of
having	a	big	profit	on	a	trade	and	then	seeing	the	market	reverse	quickly
while	I	was	still	holding	the	full	position.
I	have	a	drawdown	alert,	which	is	a	personalized	rule.	I	have	noticed	that
three	things	seem	to	be	present	at	the	beginning	of	every	drawdown	I	have
```

```
experienced:
a	2%	or	greater	loss	in	a	single	day;
a	loss	of	significant	open	profits	in	a	trade;
a	 big	 size	 trade	 doesn’t	 pay	 off—a	 trade	 that	 I	 think	 is	 a	 major
opportunity	and	put	on	in	size	and	that	then	ends	up	being	a	wash.
Another	personalized	rule	is	to	be	cognizant	of	certain	feelings	that	are	a
warning	 sign	 that	 I	 may	 be	 getting	 out	 of	 sync	 with	 the	 markets.	 The
keywords	I	watch	out	for	in	my	daily	trading	review	notes	are	FOMO	and
frustration.
Seek	clarity	over	certainty.	Trying	to	reach	for	certainty	will	keep	you	from
acting.
Always	be	prepared	for	what	could	go	wrong.	Know	what	you	will	do	if	the
opposite	of	what	you	think	will	occur	happens.
Always	trade	an	opportunity	for	what	it	is,	not	what	you	want	it	to	be.	For
example,	if	I	receive	only	a	partial	fill	on	a	trade,	I	might	be	tempted	to	run
the	trade	further	than	usual	to	compensate	for	the	smaller	size.	Doing	so
would	violate	my	process	and	generally	lead	to	worse	outcomes.	
Always	make	sure	your	stops	are	set	at	a	point	that	disproves	your	market
hypothesis;	never	use	a	monetary	stop—a	stop	point	selected	because	it	is
the	amount	of	money	you’re	willing	to	risk.	If	you	are	tempted	to	use	a
monetary	stop,	it	is	a	sure	sign	that	your	position	size	is	too	large.
Don’t	sweat	the	trades	you	missed	that	you	weren’t	prepared	to	take	in	the
first	place.	The	markets	provide	a	constant	stream	of	opportunities.	As	long
as	the	sun	rises	tomorrow,	there	will	be	another	day	I	can	make	money.	It	is
not	something	I	have	to	worry	about.
```
**What	advice	would	you	give	to	a	starting	trader?**

I	get	asked	this	question	quite	a	lot,	and	I	find	it	difficult	to	answer.	I	generally
advise	against	seeking	a	trading	career	because	most	people	are	not	willing	to
put	in	the	amount	of	effort	that	is	needed	to	succeed.	One	problem	with	markets
and	speculation	is	that	luck	plays	such	a	significant	role	in	the	short	term,	which
can	fool	people	into	thinking	their	profits	are	due	to	skill,	even	when	they	aren’t.
It	takes	a	medical	student	six-plus	years	to	qualify	as	a	doctor.	Why	would	you
expect	 reaching	 a	 high	 level	 of	 proficiency	 in	 trading	 to	 be	 any	 different?
Trading	is	like	any	other	profession;	it	requires	a	long-term	effort	to	succeed.	If
you	are	not	prepared	for	that	type	of	commitment,	then	my	advice	is	don’t	do	it


at	all.

**What	do	you	tell	someone	who	still	wants	to	be	a	trader	after	you	advise
them	against	it?**

Don’t	be	eager	to	start	trading.	Do	the	research,	find	your	approach,	and	then
you	can	begin	trading.	This	is	the	piece	of	advice	people	listen	to	the	least.

**Any	final	words?**

To	 succeed	 as	 a	 trader,	 you	 really	 need	 to	 love	 trading.	 To	 me,	 playing	 the
markets	is	like	a	never-ending	chess	game.	It’s	the	most	exciting	game	you	can
play.	If	trading	doesn’t	excite	you,	I	don’t	know	whether	the	good	times	will	be
good	enough	to	offset	the	bad	times.

The	one	question	every	trader	needs	to	be	able	to	answer	is:	What	is	your	edge?
If	you	don’t	have	a	clear	answer,	you	won’t	know	which	trades	to	focus	on	or
which	 trades	 merit	 a	 larger	 position	 size.	 One	 of	 the	 pivotal	 improvements
Dhaliwal	 made	 to	 his	 trading	 was	 identifying	 the	 types	 of	 trades	 that	 were
responsible	 for	 nearly	 all	 his	 gains.	 By	 doing	 so,	 he	 was	 able	 to	 focus	 his
attention	 on	 identifying,	 executing,	 and	 managing	 those	 trades	 that	 really
mattered.	As	an	additional	benefit,	he	was	able	to	greatly	reduce	taking	marginal
trades,	which,	on	balance,	had	a	net	negative	impact	on	his	portfolio	and	were	a
drag	on	his	focus	and	energy.	Once	you	identify	your	edge,	you	need	to	stick	to
those	trades	that	fall	in	your	sphere.	It	is	amazing	how	many	traders	are	highly
proficient	in	applying	a	specific	methodology,	yet	fall	prey	to	taking	other	types
of	trades,	which	usually	end	up	with	net	losses	and	interfere	with	the	efficient
execution	of	the	trades	they	are	skilled	at.

Dhaliwal	was	able	to	identify	the	trades	that	provided	his	true	edge	because	he
kept	a	detailed	daily	journal	of	all	his	trading,	recording	not	only	his	market
analysis	and	reasons	for	each	trade,	but	also	his	feelings.	This	detailed	journal
made	 it	 possible	 for	 Dhaliwal	 to	 categorize	 trades	 and	 define	 the	 common
denominators	 in	 the	 trades	 that	 provided	 his	 big	 wins.	 Besides	 providing	 an
invaluable	tool	for	identifying	where	a	trader	is	making	money,	a	trading	journal
can	also	be	used	to	record	lessons:	correct	decisions	and	actions,	and,	even	more
importantly,	the	mistakes	that	were	made.	Periodically	reviewing	such	a	journal
to	reinforce	these	lessons	is	one	of	the	most	effective	ways	traders	can	improve.

To	be	successful	as	a	trader,	you	need	to	be	adaptable.	Think	about	Dhaliwal’s


trading	career.	He	started	out	using	technical	analysis	primarily	but	abandoned	it
as	all	but	an	auxiliary	tool	once	he	realized	virtually	all	the	profits	were	coming
from	fundamentally	based	trades.	His	original	methodology	sought	to	capture
the	initial	price	move	on	significant	headline	events.	However,	once	algorithmic
traders	started	sparking	the	anticipated	price	moves	more	quickly	than	he	could
enter	the	orders,	he	shifted	to	a	strategy	of	fading	these	price	moves—that	is,
trading	 from	 the	 exact	 opposite	 direction	 after	 the	 initial	 price	 move.	 As
Dhaliwal	developed	as	a	trader	and	conducted	a	great	deal	of	research	with	the
aid	of	a	full-time	assistant,	macroeconomic	analysis	became	the	primary	driver
of	 his	 trades.	 Change	 has	 been	 the	 only	 constant	 in	 Dhaliwal’s	 trading
methodology.

Although	 Dhaliwal’s	 largest	 loss	 was	 primarily	 due	 to	 a	 fluke	 event—a	 rare,
erroneous	 _Financial	Times_ 	news	release—an	inadequacy	in	his	risk	management
was	also	responsible	for	the	loss.	Specifically,	Dhaliwal	didn’t	have	any	stop
protection	on	a	large	position.	If	he	had	such	a	protective	order,	he	would	have
been	stopped	out	instantaneously	when	the	actual	news	release	contradicted	the
_Financial	Times_ 	story,	thereby	significantly	curtailing	his	loss	on	the	trade.	After
this	trade,	Dhaliwal	made	sure	to	always	have	stop	protection	on	large	positions.

Another	critical	element	of	Dhaliwal’s	risk	management	is	a	specific	process	for
cutting	his	trading	size	if	a	drawdown	exceeds	certain	thresholds.	He	will	cut
size	in	half	if	a	drawdown	exceeds	5%,	and	cut	it	by	half	again	if	it	exceeds	8%.
If	 his	 drawdown	 reaches	 15%,	 Dhaliwal	 will	 stop	 trading	 altogether	 until	 he
feels	ready	to	resume.

Dhaliwal	 makes	 the	 critical	 point—one	 that	 is	 often	 overlooked—that	 the
reward/risk	ratio	of	a	trade	is	dynamic	and	can	change	dramatically	as	the	trade
is	held.	As	an	example,	consider	that	you	implement	a	trade,	looking	for	a	300-
point	gain	and	risking	a	100-point	loss.	If	the	market	then	moves	200	points	in
favor	 of	 the	 trade,	 the	 reward/risk	 is	 now	 drastically	 different	 than	 when	 the
position	was	implemented.	Dhaliwal	manages	the	dynamic	nature	of	reward/risk
in	a	trade	by	taking	partial	profits.	He	argues	that	holding	the	entire	position	until
it	is	exited	is	an	attempt	to	be	100%	right,	at	the	risk	of	being	100%	wrong.
Taking	partial	profits	as	a	trade	moves	in	your	favor	not	only	responds	to	the	fact
that	 the	 reward/risk	 of	 the	 trade	 is	 changing,	 but	 it	 is	 also	 another	 risk
management	 tool.	 If	 the	 market	 abruptly	 reverses	 against	 your	 position,	 the
action	of	having	taken	partial	profits	will	mitigate	the	profit	surrender	or	reduce
the	loss.	Although	Dhaliwal	didn’t	discuss	it,	another	way	of	adjusting	to	the
changing	 reward/risk	 of	 a	 trade	 that	 moves	 in	 the	 anticipated	 direction	 is	 to


tighten	the	protective	stop	commensurately.

Protective	stops	should	be	placed	at	a	point	that	disproves	your	trade	hypothesis.
Using	a	closer	stop	because	it	represents	the	maximum	amount	of	money	you	are
willing	to	risk	is	an	indication	that	your	position	is	too	large.	The	implication	is
that	you	should	reduce	your	position	size	so	that	you	can	choose	a	meaningful
stop	that	is	also	consistent	with	the	amount	of	money	you’re	willing	to	risk	on
the	trade.

Know	what	you	will	do	if	you	are	wrong.	Dhaliwal	plans	out	his	trades,	knowing
how	he	will	respond	in	each	possible	scenario.	Defining	your	trade	management
plan	 before	 you	 get	 into	 a	 trade	 is	 far	 preferable	 to	 doing	 so	 after	 you	 have
placed	the	position.	Why?	Because	before	you	are	in	the	trade,	you	have	the
advantage	 of	 making	 decisions	 with	 full	 objectivity.	 Once	 you	 are	 in	 the
position,	you	lose	this	advantage.

Typically,	traders	will	formulate	their	own	opinions	about	how	markets	should
respond	to	given	events	and	circumstances	and	then	trade	accordingly.	Dhaliwal
used	 the	 opposite	 approach	 of	 having	 no	 predetermined	 opinions	 but	 instead
looking	at	market	price	moves	and	then	identifying	the	causes	of	those	price
moves.	In	this	way,	Dhaliwal	let	the	markets	teach	him	what	caused	specific
price	moves	rather	than	trading	on	his	own	unproven	theories	and	assumptions.
Dhaliwal’s	track	record	is	a	testament	to	the	wisdom	of	this	approach.

Market	 price	 action	 that	 deviates	 sharply	 from	 the	 expected	 impact	 of	 a
fundamental	development	can	be	a	significant	price	signal.	The	Australian	dollar
trade	 Dhaliwal	 discussed	 provides	 a	 perfect	 example	 of	 this	 principle.	 An
unemployment	 report	 came	 out	 that	 was	 surprisingly	 bullish.	 The	 market
initially	rallied	as	expected	but	then	collapsed,	with	prices	falling	to	new	recent
lows.	The	stark	contradiction	between	the	fundamental	news	and	the	resulting
price	action	provided	an	excellent	signal	of	the	beginning	of	an	extended	bear
market.

Although	Dhaliwal	trades	primarily	based	on	his	fundamental	analysis	and	the
study	of	how	markets	react	to	fundamental	developments,	he	does	use	technical
analysis	 as	 a	 supplemental	 tool.	 One	 technical	 event	 that	 he	 believes	 has
important	 price	 implications	 is	 a	 breakout	 from	 a	 long-term	 trading	 range.	 If
sustained,	 such	 breakouts	 can	 lead	 to	 extended	 price	 moves	 in	 the	 same
direction.	The	Australian	dollar	trade	not	only	exhibited	a	counter-to-expected
response	 to	 fundamental	 news,	 but	 it	 also	 provided	 the	 technical	 signal	 of	 a
breakout	from	a	long-term	trading	range.


Dhaliwal	says,	“It’s	not	about	being	right;	it’s	about	making	money.”	The	point
is	that	the	desire	to	be	intellectually	correct	leads	many	traders	astray.	The	only
thing	 that	 matters	 is	 whether	 you	 are	 profitable,	 not	 whether	 your	 market
theories	are	correct.

One	of	Dhaliwal’s	rules	is:	Seek	clarity	over	certainty.	The	markets	are	not	about
certainty;	they	are	about	probabilities.	Waiting	for	trades	that	approach	the	ideal
of	certainty,	or	near	certainty,	will	lead	to	inaction	and	missing	many	trades	that
offer	good	probabilistic	bets.

One	 common	 trait	 among	 many	 traders	 who	 achieve	 spectacular	 success	 is	 a
love	of	the	endeavor.	Often	they	will	use	gamelike	analogies	to	describe	trading,
as	Dhaliwal	does	in	this	interview	when	he	refers	to	trading	as	a	“never-ending
chess	 game.”	 If	 you	 are	 a	 trader,	 it	 is	 worthwhile	 questioning	 your	 own
motivation.	Do	you	trade	because	you	love	the	game	of	trading	or	because	it	is	a
possible	means	to	make	a	lot	of	money?	Your	odds	are	much	better	in	the	former
case.


# John	Netto: 	Monday	Is	My	Favorite	Day

# NO	one	would	have	pegged	John	Netto	as	a	likely	candidate	for	career	success

when	 he	 graduated	 high	 school.	 He	 had	 poor	 grades	 and	 had	 failed	 at	 every
venture	 he	 tried.	 College	 was	 not	 even	 a	 consideration.	 Netto,	 however,	 was
sufficiently	self-aware	to	realize	that	he	needed	structure	and	discipline.	In	an
inspirational	moment,	not	having	given	it	any	prior	thought,	he	decided	to	join
the	Marines.	Netto	waxes	effusive	about	the	virtues	of	the	Marines	and	credits
his	experience	as	a	Marine	as	being	life-transformational.

After	 basic	 and	 infantry	 training,	 Netto	 requested	 an	 assignment	 in	 aviation,
hoping	to	be	trained	as	an	air	traffic	controller.	The	Marines	assigned	him	to	be
trained	 as	 a	 weather	 observer,	 which	 presumably	 they	 deemed	 to	 be	 close
enough.	 After	 training,	 he	 was	 stationed	 in	 Japan.	 Netto	 loved	 the	 Japanese
language	 and	 bought	 language	 instruction	 tapes,	 which	 he	 used	 to	 achieve
fluency	in	Japanese.	He	got	a	particular	kick	out	of	seeing	the	surprised	looks	he
got	when	speaking	Japanese	to	locals	because	they	always	assumed	foreigners
couldn’t	speak	their	language.	Netto’s	fluency	in	Japanese	eventually	led	to	an
assignment	to	the	prestigious	Marine	Security	Guard	detail	at	the	US	embassy	in
Tokyo.

While	 still	 enlisted,	 Netto	 attended	 the	 University	 of	 Washington	 and	 was
assigned	by	the	Marine	Corps	to	lead	Naval	Midshipmen	as	part	of	the	Marine
ROTC	program.	Following	up	on	his	discovered	love	of	Asian	languages,	Netto
majored	in	Japanese	and	Chinese.	Netto	planned	on	a	career	as	a	Marine	officer
with	an	expectation	of	an	Asian	assignment	that	would	take	advantage	of	his
language	 skills.	 This	 plan	 was	 derailed	 when	 chronic	 knee	 injuries	 made	 the
pursuit	 of	 a	 military	 career	 impossible.	 Netto	 accepted	 a	 disability	 discharge
from	 the	 Marines	 before	 he	 completed	 the	 requirements	 for	 an	 officer
commission.	His	disability	discharge	check	and	a	small	stipend	provided	Netto
with	a	starting	stake	for	trading.

Netto	approached	trading	the	same	way	he	had	approached	learning	Japanese:
self-education.	Through	reading	books	and	accessing	information	on	the	web,
Netto	developed	his	initial	trading	methodology,	which	was	entirely	based	on
technical	analysis.	As	his	experience	grew,	Netto	realized	the	importance	of	also
incorporating	 fundamentals	 into	 his	 analysis	 and	 trading.	 Eventually,	 he
developed	 a	 methodology	 that	 combined	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 dominant
fundamental	 drivers	 of	 market	 prices	 with	 technical	 analysis	 as	 a	 tool	 for


pinpointing	 the	 entry	 levels	 for	 trades	 consistent	 with	 his	 fundamental	 view.
Netto	 also	 developed	 strategies	 for	 trading	 market	 events	 and	 proprietary
software	that	allowed	these	trades	to	be	automatically	executed	in	a	fraction	of	a
second.

In	his	office,	Netto	has	an	array	of	10	large	screens.	Six	screens	are	linked	to	one
computer	and	provide	price	quote	pages,	market	charts	in	multiple	time	frames,
return/risk	monitoring	of	individual	positions,	option	quotes,	trading	windows,
and	general	computer	applications.	An	additional	four	screens	are	linked	to	a
second	computer,	which	is	devoted	to	Netto’s	event-trading	software.

In	the	10-plus	years	since	starting	his	official	track	record,	Netto	has	achieved	an
average	annual	compounded	return	of	42%	based	on	his	notional	account	levels.
(Using	notional	account	levels	instead	of	the	actual	account	levels	dampens	both
return	 and	 risk	 levels	 and	 provides	 a	 performance	 picture	 that	 is	 more
representative	of	the	intended	risk	exposure.)	The	maximum	drawdown	during
this	period	was	15%.	Netto’s	return/risk	measures	have	been	excellent,	with	an
adjusted	Sortino	ratio	of	4.7	and	a	monthly	GPR	of	4.8	(see	Appendix	2	for	the
definitions	and	explanations	of	these	metrics).

Netto’s	 trading	 methodology	 is	 sufficiently	 complicated	 and	 time-consuming
that	you	would	think	it	would	be	enough	to	keep	him	busy—and	you	would	be
wrong.	He	is	currently	attending	law	school	as	a	full-time	night	student.	It	is	not
that	Netto	seeks	to	give	up	trading	for	a	law	career.	He	readily	admits	that	he
will	probably	never	use	his	law	degree	for	monetary	compensation.	Netto	muses
that	he	would	like	to	use	it	to	do	pro	bono	work	for	veteran	advocacy.	But	his
primary	motivation	is	simply	a	desire	to	learn	the	law,	just	as	he	had	a	desire	to
learn	Japanese.	Now,	I	admit	that,	to	me,	it	seems	crazy	to	take	on	the	workload
of	law	school	solely	for	the	sake	of	knowledge,	when	you	are	already	devoting
full	time	to	the	strenuous	endeavor	of	market	analysis	and	trading.	But	then,	I	am
a	linear	thinker,	and	I	suspect	Netto	is	not.

Some	interviews	are	more	difficult	to	turn	into	text	than	others.	Netto’s	interview
was	a	bear.	For	starters,	Netto	talked	at	a	pace	reminiscent	of	a	New	Yorker
trying	to	wrap	up	a	conversation	before	rushing	off	to	catch	a	train.	Then,	he
became	so	excited	when	talking	about	trading	that	each	answer	seemed	to	go	off
in	eight	tangents—often,	none	of	which	addressed	the	question.	When	I	asked
for	a	specific	example	to	illustrate	a	point	he	had	made,	the	reply	often	mixed
together	 multiple	 examples,	 and	 not	 sequentially!	 In	 editing	 this	 interview,	 I
often	 found	 myself	 pulling	 together	 material	 hours	 apart	 in	 the	 recordings	 to


construct	a	coherent	answer.

To	be	fair,	during	the	interview,	Netto	was	repeatedly	aware	that	the	answers	he
had	 just	 provided	 might	 have	 lacked	 lucidity,	 as	 evident	 by	 his	 own	 self-
assessment	comments	during	our	meeting.	“I	guess	that	answer	was	a	bit	of	a
firehose.”	 “This	 is	 really	 esoteric.”	 “That’s	 probably	 a	 backstory	 you	 don’t
need.”	“That’s	a	spaghetti	bowl	of	information.”	“This	may	not	read	well	when
you	play	it	back.”	All	true.

**How	did	you	develop	your	interest	in	trading?**

Speculating	on	the	outcome	of	events	has	always	been	something	very	intuitive
to	me.	When	I	was	in	high	school,	I	was	a	bookie	for	students	who	wanted	to	bet
on	sports	events.	I	would	post	the	point	spread	on	all	the	football	games,	and	I
would	take	either	side.	I	would	charge	a	vig,	though,	just	like	Las	Vegas	does,
which	is	how	I	made	money.	I	would	charge	$1.10	for	every	$1.00	I	had	to	pay
out.

**So,	you	were	the	casino.**

Exactly,	I	was	the	casino.

**How	much	money	did	you	make	doing	this?**

I	was	up	about	$7,000	by	my	senior	year.	I	was	going	to	turn	18	on	December
17,	and	I	had	decided	to	stop	acting	as	a	bookie	before	my	birthday	because	I
didn’t	 want	 to	 be	 doing	 something	 illegal	 when	 I	 was	 an	 adult.	 That
Thanksgiving,	which	was	one	of	the	last	weekends	I	was	still	going	to	be	doing
this,	24	out	of	28	favorites	won.	Most	people	like	to	bet	on	the	favorite.	On	that
one	day,	I	lost	all	the	money	I	had	made	through	high	school	plus	an	additional
$1,500	that	I	didn’t	have.

**How	did	you	feel	when	you	realized	that	you	had	lost	everything	you	had
made	over	several	years,	and	then	some,	in	a	single	day?**

It	was	devastating.	But	the	biggest	thing	I	learned	from	that	experience	was	that
no	matter	how	bad	things	are,	the	sun	always	rises	the	next	day.

**Did	 the	 experience	 of	 that	 weekend	 when	 you	 were	 a	 teen	 have	 any
influence	on	you	when	you	became	a	trader	years	later?**

Absolutely.	Going	through	that	loss,	which	I	didn’t	think	was	possible,	made	me
aware	of	the	potential	for	outlier	events	when	I	began	trading,	I	appreciated	that


Lehman	Brothers	could	happen.	I	understood	that	these	seemingly	inconceivable
macro	events	could	take	place	in	the	market	because,	at	some	primal	level	in	my
formative	years	of	risk-taking,	I	was	hit	by	an	outlier	event.	Before	I	ever	began
trading,	I	knew	it	was	imperative	to	manage	risk.

**Was	that	knowledge	entirely	due	to	the	large	loss	day	you	experienced	when
you	were	in	high	school?**

I	knew	it	from	that	event	and	from	my	experience	as	a	Marine.

**Why	did	you	join	the	Marines?**

I	was	not	an	academic	achiever	when	I	was	in	high	school.	I	think	my	GPA	was
something	like	1.8.	My	only	interest	was	in	running	my	betting	operation	and	an
economics	class,	which	I	did	well	on.	Although	I	realized	college	was	important,
I	didn’t	feel	I	was	ready	for	it.	About	a	month	before	my	high	school	graduation,
a	Navy	recruiter,	who	had	come	to	our	school,	asked	me	whether	I	had	thought
of	 joining	 the	 Navy.	 I	 immediately	 told	 him,	 “No,	 I’m	 going	 to	 join	 the
Marines.”

**At	 what	 point	 before	 then	 did	 you	 know	 that	 you	 wanted	 to	 join	 the
Marines?**

I	didn’t	know.	It	popped	into	my	head	when	I	was	asked	to	join	the	Navy.	I	had
poor	 grades	 and	 lacked	 self-esteem.	 I	 had	 some	 intrinsic	 sense	 that	 I	 had
intellectual	potential,	but	I	knew	I	needed	a	lot	of	discipline.	And	the	idea	of
joining	the	toughest,	most	badass	service	just	made	sense.

**So	you	preferred	to	join	the	Marines	because	it	was	the	most	challenging
service.**

I	 chose	 the	 Marines	 both	 because	 it	 was	 the	 most	 challenging	 and	 most
structured.	I	was	self-aware	enough	to	know	that	I	had	slacked	off	in	high	school
and	that	I	wasn’t	focused.	I	knew	I	needed	the	structure.

**How	long	were	you	in	the	Marines?**

Almost	nine	years.

**Tell	me	about	your	experience.**

It	was	life-changing.	I	had	never	been	part	of	a	culture	that	held	me	accountable
for	my	actions	and	pushed	me	outside	my	comfort	zone.

**Was	it	a	difficult	experience?**

Incredibly	difficult.

**What	was	the	hardest	part	about	it?**


Believing	that	I	could	actually	finish.

**So	you	had	some	self-doubt.**

Tremendous	self-doubt.	I	had	a	bad	GPA.	I	lost	all	the	money	in	my	gambling
operation.	 Except	 for	 doing	 well	 in	 a	 state	 economics	 test,	 I	 had	 never	 done
anything	that	worked	out.	When	I	was	growing	up,	my	brother	had	a	phrase,
“AFNS,”	which	stood	for	“another	failed	Netto	scheme.”	I	was	always	trying	to
think	of	business	ideas,	and	everything	I	tried	didn’t	work.	I	had	to	overcome	my
toxic	thoughts	about	whether	I	could	do	it	or	not.

**Did	your	experience	in	the	Marines	have	an	impact	on	you	as	a	trader?**

Absolutely.	The	Marines	teach	you	discipline	and	the	ability	to	function	under
tremendous	pressure.	A	lot	of	the	training	you	do	as	a	Marine	is	to	create	such	a
stressful	environment	that	when	the	real	thing	happens,	you	can	function.	The
first	night	you	are	in	boot	camp,	after	three	hours	of	sleep,	they	are	banging	the
garbage	can	lid	screaming,	“Get	out	of	the	rack!	Get	out	of	the	rack!”	You	have
90	days	left,	and	the	first	day	felt	like	it	was	three	weeks.	I’ve	had	trading	days
that	didn’t	go	well	and	felt	like	three	weeks.	I	go	long,	and	the	market	goes
down;	I	go	short,	and	the	market	goes	up.	Trading	is	a	hard	way	to	make	an	easy
living.	The	Marines	taught	me	to	deal	with	adversity,	and	that	ability	has	been
essential	 to	 my	 success	 as	 a	 trader.	 You	 need	 to	 be	 able	 to	 deal	 with	 getting
stopped	out	five	times	in	a	row	and	still	stick	with	your	process.	The	Marines
train	you	to	deal	with	setbacks.	The	Marines	teach	you	the	importance	of	having
a	game	plan	and	being	accountable.	Trading	is	a	lot	about	accountability.	You
have	to	be	responsible	for	your	losses	and	not	blame	them	on	something	else.

**Why	did	you	leave	the	Marines?**

I	didn’t	intend	to	leave.	I	attended	the	University	of	Washington,	majoring	in
Japanese	and	Chinese,	as	part	of	the	Marine	ROTC	program.	My	plan	was	to
become	 a	 commissioned	 officer	 and	 hopefully	 get	 the	 assignment	 that	 took
advantage	of	my	language	skills.	Before	I	graduated,	I	blew	out	my	knee	playing
basketball,	 an	 injury	 that	 required	 reconstructive	 surgery.	 To	 compound	 the
problem,	 I	 had	 chronic	 tendonitis	 in	 my	 other	 knee.	 It	 was	 clear	 to	 both	 the
Marines	and	me	that	my	physical	injuries	would	make	a	career	in	the	Marines
impossible.	I	accepted	a	disability	discharge.

**How	 did	 you	 go	 from	 being	 in	 the	 Marines	 and	 majoring	 in	 Eastern
languages	to	being	a	trader?**

I	 had	 invested	 passively	 in	 mutual	 funds	 while	 I	 was	 in	 the	 Marines,	 which
provided	my	first	exposure	to	markets.	The	first	pivotal	step	in	my	journey	to


becoming	a	trader	was	taking	a	position	as	the	business	editor	of	the	student
paper	 at	 the	 University	 of	 Washington.	 I	 read	 many	 books	 on	 trading	 and
technical	analysis,	including	Joe	DiNapoli’s	book	on	Fibonacci	analysis,	which

was	very	influential.^14 	In	1999,	I	opened	a	stock	account	with	$75,000	I	had
saved	from	my	Marine	checks.	I	ran	the	account	up	to	$190,000	and	then	saw
the	account	go	all	the	way	back	down	to	$40,000	on	the	tech	stock	crash	in	2000.
I	got	past	the	first	bear	wave	in	April	2000;	it	was	the	second	bear	wave	at	the
end	of	that	year	that	got	me.

**So,	you	went	from	more	than	doubling	your	money	to	losing	all	your	gains
plus	half	your	starting	stake.	It	sounds	a	lot	like...**

[Netto	interrupts,	finishing	my	sentence]	the	high	school	bookie	operation.	I’m
seeing	a	trend	here	[he	laughs].

**How	were	you	deciding	what	to	buy	and	sell?**

That	was	part	of	the	problem.	I	followed	the	recommendations	of	a	newsletter
service	that	provided	specific	entry	and	stop	levels	on	stocks.	I	will	say	this:	In
my	entire	trading	career,	adhering	to	stops	has	never	been	a	problem.	Thanks	to
my	high	school	experience,	I	always	understood	that	I	could	blow	up.

**So	how	did	you	go	from	$190,000	to	$40,000?**

I	 lost	 the	 money	 in	 successive	 stop-outs.	 The	 sizing	 was	 a	 different	 issue.	 I
would	always	get	out	on	the	stop,	but	my	position	sizing	was	way	too	large.	I
would	naïvely	think,	“I	can	risk	$25,000	on	this	trade,”	not	appreciating	what
could	happen	if	I	lost	six	trades	in	a	row.

**Were	you	basing	all	your	trades	on	the	newsletter	recommendations?**

I	also	made	some	trades	based	on	my	market	feel,	whatever	that	means.

**So,	you	had	no	methodology.**

I	had	no	methodology	at	all.	I	was	still	learning.	At	the	time,	I	didn’t	think	I	was
still	learning.	I	thought	I	knew	what	I	was	doing	because	I	had	taken	my	account
from	$75,000	to	$190,000.

**When	did	you	resume	trading?**

Not	 long	 afterward,	 I	 developed	 a	 methodology	 based	 on	 trading	 Fibonacci
retracements.	 [A	 Fibonacci	 series	 is	 a	 sequence	 of	 numbers	 in	 which	 each
number	is	the	sum	of	the	preceding	two	numbers	(0,	1,	1,	2,	3,	5,	8,	13,	21,	34,
55,	 89...).	 The	 ratio	 of	 one	 number	 in	 the	 series	 to	 the	 following	 number
approaches	 61.8%	 as	 numbers	 get	 larger,	 and	 the	 ratio	 of	 one	 number	 to	 the
second	 following	 number	 in	 the	 series	 approaches	 38.2%.	 The	 Fibonacci


sequence	 occurs	 commonly	 in	 nature,	 such	 as	 in	 the	 spirals	 formed	 by	 some
shells	 and	 flower	 petals.	 Fibonacci	 traders	 will	 look	 for	 potential	 market
reversals	to	occur	near	the	aforementioned	key	ratios:	61.8%	and	38.2%.]

**Were	you	just	placing	trades	at	Fibonacci	retracement	levels?**

I	 was	 looking	 for	 a	 concentration	 of	 points	 in	 the	 same	 price	 area.	 A	 basic
example	of	a	trade	setup	would	be	a	61.8%	retracement	of	a	shorter	price	swing,
which	 coincided	 with	 a	 38.2%	 retracement	 of	 a	 longer	 price	 swing,	 both	 of
which	coincided	with	other	technical	support	or	resistance	levels.	I	would	take
positions	 at	 these	 points	 where	 multiple	 support	 or	 resistance	 indicators	 were
concentrated	in	the	same	area.

**Was	this	approach	successful?**

I	was	profitable	in	both	2001	and	2002,	trading	mainly	from	the	short	side.	But
then	 I	 had	 a	 disastrous	 day	 on	 March	 17,	 2003,	 which	 was	 the	 day	 when
President	Bush	issued	an	ultimatum	to	Saddam	Hussein	to	step	down	under	the
threat	of	a	US	invasion.

That	morning,	the	market	opens	lower,	and	I	start	selling.	The	market	quickly
reverses	 to	 the	 upside,	 and	 I	 get	 stopped	 out.	 At	 that	 point,	 I’m	 down	 about
$14,000	for	the	day,	which	is	bad,	but	manageable.	Then	I	go	short	a	second
time	and	get	stopped	out.	Now,	I’m	down	$28,000.	I	step	away	and	come	back.	I
go	short	a	third	time	and	get	stopped	out.	Now,	I’m	down	$39,000.	I	step	away,
come	 back,	 and	 go	 short	 again.	 This	 time,	 the	 market	 starts	 falling.	 When	 I
recover	 half	 my	 loss.	 I	 start	 thinking,	 “I’m	 going	 to	 pull	 this	 out!”	 I	 get	 the
account	back	 as	far	 as	 down	only	 $13,000,	and	 then	 the	loss	 starts	 widening
again.	I	get	stopped	out	a	fourth	time,	and	now	I’m	down	$40,000.	I	take	one	last
shot,	and	by	the	end	of	the	day,	I’m	down	$63,000.

In	that	single	day,	I	lost	all	the	money	I	had	made	in	the	prior	year	or	so.	It	was
such	bad	trading,	but	that’s	what	happened.	I	was	what	we	call	in	Vegas	“on	tilt.”

**On	tilt?**

“On	tilt”	is	a	poker	term	for	a	player	who	loses	emotional	control	in	trying	to
recover	a	loss,	making	aggressive,	bad	bets,	which	end	up	amplifying	the	total
loss.

**Was	your	trading	that	day	part	of	your	methodology?**

The	first	trade	was	entirely	consistent	with	my	methodology.	The	market	had
rallied	 in	 the	 previous	 few	 days,	 reached	 a	 resistance	 point,	 and	 then	 gapped
lower	on	the	next	opening,	confirming	a	reversal.	But	after	I	took	that	first	loss,	I


should	have	been	done.	All	the	other	trades	were	just	tilt.

**That	day	is	a	classic	example	of	a	market	going	counter	to	the	expected
response	to	a	news	item.**

Completely.

**I	still	kick	myself	for	not	going	long	on	election	night	2016	when	the	market
initially	sold	off	sharply,	as	it	became	apparent	that	Trump	would	pull	out	a
surprise	victory,	but	then	reversed	abruptly,	moving	steadily	higher.	I	fully
recognized	 then	 that	 the	 market’s	 counter-to-expected	 price	 action
represented	a	classic	buy	signal,	but	I	was	so	disheartened	by	the	Trump
win	that	I	couldn’t	bring	myself	to	go	long.**

In	our	email	correspondence	before	the	interview,	Netto	attached	a	copy	of	a
letter	 he	 had	 sent	 to	 the	 NFA	 (National	 Futures	 Association,	 the	 futures
industry’s	self-regulatory	organization)	on	January	4,	2010.	The	letter	affirmed
that	he	would	be	trading	his	account	at	a	notional	level	of	$1	million.	He	also
sent	 me	 the	 NFA’s	 confirmation	 letter	 response	 and	 an	 audited	 track	 record
beginning	in	January	2010.	In	futures,	the	notional	account	level	indicates	the
account	size	assumed	to	be	traded	and	is	used	when	the	amount	of	money	in	an
account	 is	 not	 representative	 of	 the	 risk	 level	 being	 traded.	 Futures	 margin
requirements	represent	only	a	small	percentage	of	contract	values.	If	a	futures
account	is	not	funded	with	a	substantial	amount	of	excess	capital,	the	amount	of
money	 in	 the	 account	 may	 considerably	 understate	 the	 assumed	 account	 size
being	traded,	resulting	in	exaggerated	profits	and	losses.	Using	notional	account
levels,	instead	of	actual	account	levels,	in	such	circumstances,	will	reduce	both
returns	and	risk	metrics	(e.g.,	volatility,	drawdowns),	and	is	intended	to	generate
more	realistic	performance	numbers.

**The	NFA	letter	and	the	performance	audit	you	sent	me	indicates	that	you
started	 to	 keep	 an	 official	 track	 record	 in	 January	 2010.	 I	 have	 two
questions.	First,	how	did	you	do	in	your	trading	between	the	large	loss	in
March	2003	and	the	start	of	your	official	track	record	in	January	2010?
Second,	since	you	had	been	trading	for	many	years	before,	why	did	you
decide	to	start	your	official	record	in	January	2010?**


I	was	moderately	profitable	during	that	interim,	but	nothing	spectacular.	I	chose
January	 2010,	 partially	 because	 it	 was	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 decade,	 and	 also
because	I	wanted	to	take	my	trading	to	another	level.	Although	I	was	trading	all
along,	 I	 made	 a	 living	 primarily	 from	 the	 commissions	 I	 was	 earning	 as	 an
introducing	broker.	My	goal	was	to	be	able	to	focus	totally	on	trading.	I	gave	up
the	brokerage	accounts	in	2011.

**Did	your	methodology	change	over	those	years	from	the	Fibonacci-based
technical	approach	you	described	before?**

Yes,	the	critical	change	was	realizing	the	importance	of	the	prevailing	market
narrative	 and	 incorporating	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 market	 narrative	 in	 my
trading.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	what	you	mean	by	market	narrative?**

The	 narrative	 is	 another	 term	 for	 the	 market	 regime.	 For	 example,	 five-year
Treasury	notes	are	paying	1.5%	right	now.	The	dividend	yield	on	the	S&P	is
2.8%.	 [This	 interview	 was	 conducted	 in	 August	 2019.]	 The	 dominant	 market
narrative	is	that,	given	the	significant	yield	advantage	in	the	S&P,	money	will
flow	into	equities.	In	this	type	of	environment,	it’s	challenging	to	be	short	the
S&P.	Instead,	you	want	to	be	buying	the	S&P	near	key	technical	points	because
real	investment	flows	will	be	there,	providing	fundamental	support.

As	another	example,	we	are	currently	in	a	regime	where	there	is	a	massive	chase
for	 yield.	 There	 is	 $17	 trillion	 of	 negative	 yield	 instruments	 out	 there.	 This
regime	largely	explains	what	is	fueling	the	ongoing	bull	market	in	gold.	Why?
Because,	in	a	sense,	gold	is	a	zero	yielding	currency.	The	fact	that	gold	yields
zero	makes	it	a	better	asset	to	hold	that	$17	trillion	of	assets	you	have	to	pay	to
own.	That	factor	is	the	big	driver	of	gold	right	now.

**So,	if	you	have	this	type	of	favorable	regime	for	gold,	does	that	imply	that
you	 only	 trade	 gold	 from	 the	 long	 side,	 as	 long	 as	 conditions	 remain
conducive	for	the	market	chasing	yield?**

That’s	predominantly	true,	but	not	always.

**What	would	prompt	you	to	go	short	in	the	face	of	this	long-term	bullish
factor	that	you	have	argued	is,	currently,	the	driving	force	behind	gold’s
price	movement?**

You	could	get	an	event	that	will	cause	a	sharp	countermovement	in	the	price	of
gold.	 For	 example,	 if,	 unexpectedly,	 there	 is	 talk	 that	 Europe	 will	 implement
fiscal	 stimulus,	 European	 bonds	 will	 go	 through	 a	 headline-scare	 correction.


That	event	would	cause	gold	to	sell	off	because	it	has	been	benefiting	from	a
negative	yield	environment.	Also,	if	a	narrative	is	widely	followed,	eventually,
the	 trade	 can	 get	 crowded,	 making	 the	 market	 vulnerable	 to	 a	 sharp
countermove,	 especially	 if	 there	 is	 a	 surprise	 event	 adverse	 to	 the	 prevailing
narrative.

**So	then	you	might	play	a	short-term	correction	in	gold,	even	if	you	are	long-
term	bullish.**

Absolutely,	because	when	you	get	these	sustained,	long-term	trends,	and	there	is
a	surprise	event,	the	corrections	can	be	violent.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	a	specific	trade	that	was	driven	by	your
interpretation	of	the	market	narrative?**

In	May	2013,	then	Chairman	Bernanke	indicated	that	the	Fed	was	going	to	move
from	 calendar-based	 to	 data-driven	 decisions	 in	 determining	 interest	 rate
adjustments.	 What	 does	 that	 mean?	 It	 means	 that	 any	 economic	 data—job
numbers,	 retail	 sales,	 etc.—was	 going	 to	 be	 more	 impactful	 than	 before.
Bernanke’s	 comments	 changed	 the	 market	 narrative.	 On	 July	 5,	 2013,	 the
Employment	Report	showed	a	large	number	of	jobs	being	added.	Although	I	was
already	positioned	short	Treasurys	before	the	report,	I	shorted	a	lot	more	because
I	thought	the	figure	would	have	a	larger-than-expected	impact,	given	the	Fed’s
recent	switch	from	calendar-based	to	data-based	guidance.	That	was	my	most
profitable	day	ever.	I	specialize	in	identifying	shifts	in	the	market	narrative	that
are	likely	to	result	in	market	repricings.	I	also	try	to	determine	what	the	narrative
is,	going	into	any	significant	event.

**Although	you	weren’t	incorporating	this	approach	in	your	trading	in	2003,
retrospectively,	what	was	the	narrative	on	your	big	losing	day	in	March
2003?**

The	narrative	was	that	we	were	still	in	a	two-year	bear	market,	and	with	the	US
about	to	go	to	war,	the	stock	market	would	go	back	to	new	lows.	The	narrative
was	 compelling,	 and	 it	 is	 what	 I	 believed	 at	 the	 time.	 However,	 when	 a
convincing	narrative	is	contradicted	by	the	market	price	action,	the	reversal	from
the	narrative-driven	trading	can	be	violent.

**When	did	you	start	incorporating	the	market	narrative	in	your	trading?**

Probably	the	first	market	in	which	my	market	narrative	played	an	essential	role
in	my	trading	was	gold	in	2008.	I	will	tell	you	what	I	did	right	and	what	I	did
wrong.	 My	 narrative	 was:	 The	 world	 is	 crashing,	 the	 Fed	 will	 have	 to	 ease;
therefore,	gold	is	going	higher.	That	was	the	correct	narrative	for	the	first	three


quarters,	and	I	did	quite	well	trading	gold	primarily	from	the	long	side.	But	what
I	missed	was	that	when	the	world	became	concerned	about	deflation,	gold	would
sell	off	with	the	rest	of	the	market,	which	is	what	happened	in	the	fourth	quarter
of	 2008.	 I	 also	 missed	 the	 fact	 that	 because	 they	 were	 being	 hit	 by	 large
withdrawals,	 many	 hedge	 funds	 had	 to	 raise	 money,	 and	 hedge	 funds	 were
primarily	long	gold.	So	they	had	to	sell	gold	along	with	everything	else.

**So	 far,	 we	 have	 talked	 about	 how	 technical	 analysis	 and	 the	 market
narrative	play	a	role	in	your	trading	methodology.	What	else	is	important?**

Event	trading	has	probably	been	the	most	important	contributor	to	my	trading
profits	during	the	past	10	years.	There	are	both	unplanned	events	and	planned
events.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	each?**

Last	Friday,	while	he	is	flying	to	a	G-7	meeting,	Trump	tweets	some	crazy	shit
about	how,	when	he	lands,	he	will	implement	retaliatory	measures	against	China.
In	his	tweets,	Trump	was	visibly	irate.	That	is	an	example	of	an	unplanned	event.
You	 cannot	 afford	 to	 be	 long	 risk	 knowing	 that	 later	 that	 day,	 Trump	 is
presumably	going	to	announce	additional	tariffs	against	China.

**How	do	you	respond	to	that?**

You	sell	risk,	and	you	sell	it	with	abandon.

**What	was	your	trade?**

I	sold	the	S&P.

**But	doesn’t	the	market	sell	off	immediately	on	that	tweet?**

Not	just	immediately,	but	for	the	next	hour.

**When	did	you	get	short?**

Right	 away.	 I	 listen	 to	 an	 audio	 squawk	 called	 Trade	 the	 News,	 which	 is	 a
website	that	does	nothing	but	track,	filter,	and	read	market-moving	news	items
all	day	long.	I	cannot	watch	a	news	screen	while	I’m	trading—it	would	be	too
distracting—so	I	have	the	audio	streaming	in.	As	soon	as	I	heard	them	read	that
Trump	tweet,	I	went	short.

**How	much	was	the	market	down	by	the	time	you	got	your	order	filled?**

The	market	was	down	eight	full	points,	which	was	not	a	problem;	it	went	down
another	50	points.

**What	is	the	broader	lesson	that	comes	out	of	that	trade?**

The	lesson	is	that	you	have	to	understand	the	market	narrative,	so	you	know


what	is	and	isn’t	a	surprise	and	act	accordingly.	But	you	have	to	know	it	is	a
surprise.	If	you	trade	without	knowing,	you	are	just	a	sucker	giving	your	money
away,	and	you	will	likely	be	near	the	high	tick	on	the	buy	and	the	low	tick	on	the
sell.

**So,	your	event	trading	is	intricately	tied	to	your	market	narrative.**

Absolutely!	The	narrative	will	determine	how	you	interpret	market	events.	You
can	 have	 the	 same	 event	 have	 very	 different	 price	 impacts	 depending	 on	 the
market	narrative.	For	example,	if	no	one	expects	OPEC	to	cut	production,	and
they	cut	production,	the	energy	markets	will	be	caught	offside,	and	you	can	have
a	significant	price	response.	On	the	other	hand,	if	the	same	size	cut	occurs,	but	it
is	widely	anticipated,	there	may	be	no	price	reaction	at	all,	or	the	market	might
even	reverse	once	the	news	is	out.	So	knowing	the	market	narrative	is	critical	to
my	event	trading.	It	also	makes	my	technical	analysis	more	effective	by	giving
me	insight	as	to	when	a	particular	chart	formation	would	be	more	likely	to	result
in	a	large	price	move.

**What	is	an	example	of	a	planned	event	trade?**

The	USDA’s	Crop	Production	report	released	earlier	this	month	[August	2019]
provides	a	perfect	example.	As	a	backdrop,	in	the	June	report,	the	USDA	had
reported	corn	plantings	at	91.7	million	acres.	This	figure	was	generally	viewed
with	considerable	skepticism	because	it	was	widely	expected	that	acreage	would
be	 significantly	 lower,	 given	 the	 severe	 flooding	 in	 the	 Midwest,	 which	 had
delayed	 plantings.	 The	 USDA	 agreed	 to	 re-survey	 plantings	 in	 14	 states	 and
update	the	acreage	estimate	in	the	August	report.	Going	into	the	August	report,
the	market	was	expecting	a	 _significant_ 	reduction	in	the	acreage	estimate.	The
USDA,	however,	only	reduced	the	corn	plantings	estimate	by	1.7	million	acres
to	90	million	acres,	which	was	much	less	of	a	reduction	than	expected	and	a	very
bearish	number.	And	the	kicker	was	that	they	also	increased	the	yield	estimate.
The	market	was	expecting	an	acreage	number	closer	to	87	million.	There	wasn’t
an	analyst	with	an	estimate	anywhere	near	90	million.	When	you	get	that	type	of
an	outlier,	it	is	almost	like	the	market	is	giving	you	the	money.	The	repricing	has
to	happen.	There	is	just	not	enough	liquidity	for	everyone	who	wants	to	get	out
to	be	able	to	get	out.

**But	if	the	number	was	that	bearish,	wouldn’t	the	market	go	limit	down
instantaneously?	 [Limit	 down	 is	 the	 maximum	 permitted	 daily	 price
decline.]**

You	are	assuming	markets	are	efficient,	but	they	are	not	efficient.	The	market


went	 limit	 down,	 but	 it	 didn’t	 go	 there	 immediately.	 I	 was	 able	 to	 get	 short
almost	instantaneously	because	of	MPACT.

**What	is	MPACT?**

MPACT,	 an	 acronym	 for	 market	 price	 action,	 is	 the	 software	 program	 that	 I
showed	 you	 earlier	 this	 morning,	 which	 reads	 and	 evaluates	 the	 news	 in
milliseconds	and	then	enters	the	appropriate	order.

**So,	in	your	software,	you	have	predefined	what	trade	action	to	take	for	each
possible	estimate	value	the	USDA	might	release.**

Correct.	 Execution	 is	 critical.	 I	 invested	 a	 substantial	 portion	 of	 my	 trading
profits	 and	 net	 worth	 in	 building	 MPACT,	 which	 is	 an	 event	 interpretation
application.	 The	 software	 trades	 the	 market	 price	 action	 consistent	 with
predetermined	scenarios	for	an	event.	A	big	part	of	what	I	do	is	defining	20,	30,
40	potential	scenarios	before	the	event,	as	well	as	the	trade	action	associated
with	each	scenario.

I	 can	 spend	 a	 week	 preparing	 for	 a	 Fed	 event	 dissecting	 multiple	 qualitative
aspects.	When	I	build	a	score	for	a	Fed	event,	I’ll	have	a	framework	to	interpret
what	the	Fed	says	in	regards	to	four	things:	(1)	the	economy;	(2)	inflation;	(3)
future	 rate	 paths;	 and	 (4)	 any	 idiosyncratic	 factors.	 These	 four	 factors	 are
dynamically	 weighted.	 Accordingly,	 MPACT	 will	 read	 the	 Fed	 release	 and
evaluate	it	for	each	of	these	four	areas	and	generate	a	score.	Then	MPACT	will
select	 the	 prepared	 scenario	 based	 on	 the	 score	 from	 the	 statement.	 Each
scenario	will	also	specify	the	trades	to	be	taken,	if	any.

**Is	this	software	that	you	created?**

I	designed	it	and	hired	a	development	team	to	do	the	programming.	The	project
took	six	years	to	build	and	refine.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	how	MPACT	traded	a	Fed	announcement?**

In	 December	 2018,	 I	 thought	 that	 the	 Fed	 would	 not	 hike	 rates—despite	 the
market	pricing	in	nearly	a	100%	chance	of	a	hike—and	that	if	they	did	raise
rates,	 the	 announcement	 would	 include	 some	 indication	 that	 they	 were	 done
hiking.	Instead,	Fed	Chairman	Powell’s	comments	included	the	line,	“It	is	more
likely	that	the	economy	will	grow	in	a	way	that	will	call	for	two	interest	rate
increases	over	the	course	of	next	year.”	That	one	line	was	enough	to	send	the
markets	crashing.

**Although	 it	 was	 in	 total	 contradiction	 to	 your	 expectations,	 did	 your
prepared	scenarios	include	the	Fed	indicating	there	would	be	a	couple	more**


**hikes?**

They	 sure	 did.	 I	 was	 long	 the	 S&P	 and	 gold	 going	 into	 the	 announcement
because	I	was	expecting	the	Fed	wouldn’t	hike.	MPACT	automatically	sold	me
out	of	my	positions	and	reversed	to	the	short	side.

**Okay,	that’s	a	clear-cut	example.	However,	what	about	the	case	where	there
are	 statements	 with	 contradictory	 implications	 within	 the	 same
announcement?**

Yes,	that	happened	in	March	2017,	it	was	my	worst	trading	day	ever.	I	thought
that	 if	 the	 Fed	 left	 the	 door	 open	 for	 another	 hike	 in	 June,	 it	 would	 be	 very
bearish	for	the	interest	rate	markets.	The	Fed	did	that,	and	I	went	heavily	short
the	five-year	T-notes.	I	lost	$210,000	that	day,	giving	back	all	my	profits	year	to
date.

**What	exactly	was	the	mistake?**

Although	the	Fed	indicated	the	likelihood	of	a	June	hike,	the	overall	statement
contained	a	score	of	other	dovish	elements,	some	that	I	had	failed	to	anticipate	in
my	scenario	creation	process.	At	that	point,	I	didn’t	have	the	level	of	detail	in	my
score	generation	process	that	I	do	now.	There	is	a	learning	curve	involved	in	this
process.	So,	although	mistakes	cost	money,	they	can	also	lead	to	opportunity.

**Let’s	discuss	emotions	and	trading.	I	know	you	have	a	contrarian	view	on
the	subject.	Can	you	elaborate	on	how	you	see	the	influence	of	emotions	in
trading?**

Emotions	are	your	friend,	not	your	enemy.	The	human	emotions	that	we	feel	can
be	used	as	a	signal	source.	Let	me	give	you	a	specific	trade	as	an	example.	In
September	2015,	the	S&P	rolled	over	and	broke	down	sharply	to	the	area	of	the
August	relative	low.	I	was	overwhelmed	by	this	animalistic	sense	that	the	S&P
was	going	to	crash.	I	went	short	200	E-mini	S&P	contracts,	which	was	way	too
large	a	position	for	me.

Part	of	my	trading	process	is	to	ask	myself	where	I	am	on	the	emotional	scale.
Am	 I	 highly	 afraid?	 Am	 I	 highly	 greedy?	 Or,	 am	 I	 emotionally	 balanced
somewhere	between	the	two?	That	was	an	instance	where	I	was	at	one	end	of	the
emotional	 spectrum—highly	 greedy.	 When	 I	 asked	 myself,	 “What	 is	 your
respect	for	the	risk	level	right	now?”	I	realized	the	answer	was,	“None.”	I	felt
that	shorting	right	there	without	any	process	behind	me	was	free	money.	As	soon
as	I	realized	that,	I	covered	my	entire	position	immediately.

The	best	positions	for	me	are	when	I	still	have	some	element	of	unease.	I	assess
the	tension	in	my	body	when	I	am	in	a	trade.	I	want	to	be	focused	and	still	feel


some	anxiety.	In	contrast,	if	I	exhale	in	relief	after	a	position	has	gone	my	way
and	 feel	 too	 relaxed,	 that	 is	 a	 warning	 sign	 of	 a	 possible	 impending	 market
reversal.	If	I	buy	gold	at	$1,500,	and	it	then	goes	to	$1,530,	and	I	feel,	“I	nailed
this	trade;	I	better	buy	more	before	it	runs	away,”	I	can	assure	you,	it	will	be
back	to	$1,518	in	no	time.

**So,	ironically,	you	would	be	more	inclined	to	add	to	a	position	when	you	still
feel	nervous	about	it,	not	when	you	feel	really	confident.**

Yes!	Correct!

**You	 are	 saying	 that	 people	 like	 me	 who	 advise	 traders	 to	 get	 the
emotionality	out	of	trading	are	wrong.**

Oh,	my	God!	Why	would	you	want	to	do	that?	You	would	be	throwing	away	a
useful	signal	source.	If	you	have	to	choose	one,	would	you	rather	replicate	the
trades	of	the	three	most	successful	traders	you	knew,	or	would	you	rather	do	the
opposite	of	the	three	worst	traders	you	knew?	I	would	always	choose	to	do	the
opposite	 of	 the	 worst	 traders.	 It’s	 hard	 for	 good	 traders	 to	 consistently	 make
money,	but	it’s	not	hard	at	all	for	bad	traders	to	consistently	lose	money.	What
are	the	characteristics	of	bad	traders?	They	have	no	process.	They	make	their
decisions	 emotionally	 and	 are	 incredibly	 impulsive,	 which	 is	 why	 they	 are
swayed	by	panic	and	end	up	buying	near	highs	and	selling	near	lows.

**When	I	tell	people	to	get	emotions	out	of	trading,	it	is	because	emotional
trades	are	usually	wrong.	But	what	you	are	saying	is	that	your	proxy	for	the
worst	traders—a	valuable	indicator—is	being	aware	of	your	own	emotional
extremes.**

Exactly!	 You	 need	 to	 understand	 your	 own	 emotionality,	 journal	 it,	 and
potentially	develop	it	as	another	signal	source	for	what	you	do.

**Contrast	the	characteristics	that	differentiate	winning	traders	from	losing
traders.**

Winning	traders	 _get	the	joke_ .	They	realize	that	they	can	lose	even	when	they	do
everything	right.	Winning	traders	have	a	process,	the	discipline	to	follow	the
process,	 and	 a	 commitment	 to	 strive	 for	 continuous	 improvement.	 They
understand	that	even	incremental	improvements	can	have	a	profound	effect	on
their	P&L.	Losing	traders	are	looking	for	a	silver	bullet,	and	if	it	doesn’t	work
immediately,	they	are	onto	the	next	thing.

**What	advice	do	you	have	for	other	traders?**

You	don’t	have	to	make	money	right	away.	Sometimes	not	losing	is	every	bit	as


important	as	winning.	Risk-taking	with	a	process	leads	to	success,	while	risk-
taking	on	impulse	leads	to	regret.

**Why	do	you	think	you’ve	been	successful?**

I	am	successful	because	Monday	is	my	favorite	day	of	the	week.	When	you	love
what	you	do,	you’re	going	to	be	successful.

I,	 as	 well	 as	 a	 number	 of	 the	 Market	 Wizards	 I	 have	 interviewed,	 have	 long
advised	eliminating	emotions	from	trading.	John	Netto,	on	the	other	hand,	takes
the	 provocative	 view	 that	 emotions	 are	 one	 of	 a	 trader’s	 most	 useful	 tools.
Although	it	appears	that	we	are	offering	contradictory	advice,	there	is	actually	no
disagreement.	Netto	also	believes	that	emotions	will	usually	have	a	detrimental
impact	on	trading	decisions.	In	fact,	the	tendency	of	emotions	to	lead	to	bad
trading	decisions	is	precisely	what	Netto	seeks	to	tap	into	as	a	signal	source.
Netto	strives	to	be	mindful	of	his	own	emotional	extremes,	which	will	be	as
deleterious	to	trading	outcomes	as	anyone	else’s,	as	warning	signals	calling	for
immediate	 corrective	 action.	 For	 example,	 if	 Netto	 is	 in	 a	 trade	 that	 moves
strongly	in	his	favor,	and	he	then	catches	himself	thinking,	“This	trade	can’t	lose,
I	better	load	up	on	this	position	before	it	runs	away,”	he	will,	instead,	liquidate
immediately.

Although	 most	 traders	 tend	 to	 gravitate	 to	 either	 fundamental	 analysis	 or
technical	analysis,	some	of	the	best	traders	combine	the	two.	Netto	provides	a
good	illustration	of	how	fundamental	analysis	and	technical	analysis	can	be	used
synergistically.	 Netto	 will	 apply	 his	 understanding	 of	 the	 dominant	 market
narrative	or	regime	to	determine	whether	he	will	trade	a	given	market	from	the
long	side	or	short	side.	Once	this	fundamental	bias	is	established,	he	will	then
overlay	his	technical	analysis	to	select	trade	entry	points.	Typically,	these	will	be
reactions	 to	 support	 or	 resistance	 levels	 within	 what	 he	 perceives	 to	 be	 the
market’s	prevailing	directional	bias.

Event	trading	is	another	essential	component	of	Netto’s	methodology.	He	trades
both	scheduled	events,	such	as	Fed	statements	and	government	reports,	as	well
as	unanticipated	events.	Netto	stresses	that	to	successfully	trade	events,	you	need
to	have	a	good	sense	of	whether	any	given	outcome	is	a	surprise.	He	will	only
trade	 event	 outcomes	 that	 he	 considers	 to	 be	 surprises	 relative	 to	 market
expectations.	 Execution	 speed	 is	 obviously	 critical	 in	 such	 trades,	 since	 the


market	will	typically	respond	quickly	and	dynamically	to	surprises.	Netto	has
solved	this	problem	by	developing	his	own	proprietary	software	that	can	read	the
text	related	to	an	event,	determine	the	trade	implications,	if	any,	and	place	the
appropriate	trade,	all	in	a	split	second.	For	this	program	to	work,	Netto	needs	to
define	 the	 trade	 implications	 of	 scores	 of	 possible	 scenarios	 before	 each
scheduled	event,	a	work-intensive	task.	The	rapid	execution	that	results	from	this
process	 means	 that	 if	 his	 analysis	 is	 correct,	 Netto	 will	 capture	 a	 substantial
portion	 of	 the	 market	 move,	 even	 when	 the	 event	 triggers	 a	 near-immediate
market	response.

After	taking	a	loss—particularly	a	substantial	loss—it	is	common	for	traders	to
experience	a	compulsion	to	try	to	quickly	make	money	back	in	the	same	market.
Resist	this	temptation!	Early	in	his	trading	career,	Netto	took	a	large	loss	in	a
short	S&P	position.	This	initial	trade,	however,	was	not	a	mistake.	The	trade	was
consistent	with	his	methodology,	but	Netto	was	simply	wrong	on	his	directional
market	call.	Had	the	story	ended	there,	it	would	have	been	a	bad	day,	but	not	a
catastrophic	one.	The	problem	was	that	Netto	became	fixated	on	trying	to	make
his	 money	 back	 _in	the	same	market_ .	 He	 then	 proceeded	 to	 go	 short	 and	 get
stopped	out	four	more	times	that	day.	None	of	these	additional	four	trades	had
anything	to	do	with	his	methodology.	Instead,	he	was	caught	up	in	an	emotional
spiral	 that	 blinded	 him	 to	 reasonable	 trading	 decisions.	 To	 use	 Netto’s	 poker
terminology,	he	was	 _on	tilt_ .	By	the	time	it	was	all	over,	he	had	quadrupled	his
large	initial	loss	and	surrendered	nearly	a	year’s	worth	of	profits.	When	you	lose
money	in	a	market,	let	it	go.	Be	on	guard	against	the	urge	to	make	money	back
by	taking	previously	unplanned	trades.

One	 theme	 that	 has	 cropped	 up	 in	 several	 of	 the	 interviews	 in	 this	 book,
including	this	one,	is	the	concept	that	a	counter-to-expected	market	response	to	a
news	 development	 can	 provide	 a	 valuable	 timing	 signal.	 President	 Bush’s
ultimatum	to	Saddam	Hussein,	which	signaled	the	imminent	start	of	the	Second
Gulf	War,	was	viewed	as	a	bearish	development,	especially	with	equities	still
near	the	lows	of	a	two-year-long	bear	market.	The	market	opened	lower	on	the
news,	as	expected,	but	then	reversed,	closing	sharply	higher.	This	unexpected
price	action	signaled	the	beginning	of	a	long-term	bull	market.

Another	example	of	the	same	principle	was	provided	by	the	stock	market	price
action	on	election	night	2016.	It	was	widely	assumed	that	Trump	would	lose	the
election	and	that	in	the	unlikely	event	he	won,	the	market	would	sell	off	sharply.
When	the	returns	started	to	make	it	clear	that	Trump	would	win	an	upset	victory,
equities	 began	 to	 tank	 precisely	 as	 anticipated.	 But	 then	 prices	 reversed	 their


initial	losses	and	moved	sharply	higher	throughout	the	night.	This	unexpected
market	response	to	the	news	marked	the	start	of	a	near	uninterrupted	14-month
run-up	in	stock	prices.

# Part	II:	Stock	Traders


# Jeffrey	Neumann: 	Penny	Wise,	Dollar	Wise

One	day	I	received	the	following	intriguing	email:

```
Hello	Mr.	Schwager,
I’m	reaching	out	to	you	on	a	whim	because	I’ve	got	what	I	consider	a	quite
fantastic	 stock	 market	 success	 story.	 After	 years	 of	 basic	 silence,	 I’m
looking	for	an	outlet	for	my	story	to	be	told,	and	you	are	what	I	consider	the
current	 best	 at	 telling	 these	 tales.	 I’ve	 previously	 kept	 myself	 in	 the
shadows	 of	 the	 stock	 trading	 community,	 mainly	 due	 to	 my	 low-key
personality,	 a	 little	 bit	 due	 to	 security	 (hackers	 et	 al.),	 but	 more	 than
anything	because	it	keeps	life	simple	for	me.	Even	my	best	friends	have	no
clue	about	my	success	in	this	industry.	Now	that	I’ve	got	two	young	kids,	I
think	they	would	one	day	enjoy	my	story	to	have	been	put	down	in	pen	and
paper	somewhere,	somehow,	for	them	to	see	and	appreciate	(beyond	the
material	things	that	they	will	be	the	recipients	of	one	day).
I’ll	spare	you	the	details	in	this	initial	correspondence,	but	I	started	trading
in	2002	with	$2,500	and	have	parlayed	it	into	$50	million	in	profits	(pre-
tax).	I’ve	traveled	the	world	to	many	dozens	of	countries	(guessing	60+),
culminating	with	visiting	all	seven	continents	the	year	of	my	30th	birthday.
I’m	currently	in	my	mid-30s,	and	my	style	has	progressed	over	the	years
from	pattern	day	trader	to	swing	trader.	I’m	extremely	thematic	in	my	stock
selection	 style	 and	 pyramid	 into	 positions	 very	 similarly	 to	 Jesse
Livermore.	I’ve	never	taken	a	dime	of	outside	invested	capital	and	have
only	been	a	one-man	operation.
If	you	have	any	interest	or	any	recommendation	on	someone	that	could	help
me	tell	this	tale,	I	would	appreciate	it	greatly!
Thank	you	for	your	time.
Jeff	Neumann
```
I	replied	that	I	was	tentatively	planning	to	do	another	 _Market	Wizards	_ book,	but
not	 for	 a	 while.	 As	 events	 transpired,	 six	 months	 later,	 I	 decided	 to	 begin
working	on	a	new	book	and	asked	Neumann	to	send	me	copies	of	his	monthly
account	 statements	 as	 evidence.	 He	 was	 able	 to	 send	 me	 ten	 years’	 worth	 of
statements	(as	far	back	as	available	from	his	broker).	To	fill	in	the	earlier	years,
he	provided	me	with	the	relevant	pages	of	his	tax	returns.	Altogether,	his	record
spanned	17	years.	His	starting	equity	was	actually	$7,700	instead	of	$2,500,	the


difference	being	a	stock	position	his	father	had	left	him,	which	he	didn’t	use	to
trade.	Using	the	higher	starting	equity	level	of	$7,700,	Neumann	compounded
his	 account	 at	 an	 average	 rate	 of	 80%	 per	 annum.	 This	 figure	 is	 actually
understated	 because	 it	 doesn’t	 account	 for	 his	 large	 net	 withdrawals	 during
2002–2008,	 a	 period	 for	 which	 the	 monthly	 statements	 that	 would	 allow
adjusting	 the	 return	 calculations	 for	 these	 withdrawals	 were	 unavailable.	 The
percentage	returns	during	his	earlier	years	when	his	account	equity	was	lower
were	 particularly	 high	 and	 amplified	 his	 average	 return	 for	 the	 entire	 track
record.	 For	 the	 past	 ten	 years	 for	 which	 monthly	 brokerage	 statements	 were
available	and	his	starting	account	equity	level	was	$2.3	million	in	January	2009,
his	average	annual	compounded	return	was	53%.

Turning	a	few	thousand	dollars	into	$50	million	is	only	part	of	the	story.	Perhaps
the	real	kicker	is	that	Neumann	made	a	large	portion	of	his	fortune	trading	penny
stocks.	Now	you	can	fit	most	of	what	I	know	about	penny	stocks	onto—well,	a
penny.	My	impression	was	that	penny	stocks	represented	a	financial	backwater
replete	 with	 worthless	 companies	 and	 pump-and-dump	 schemes	 designed	 to
fleece	suckers—a	perception	that	is	probably	still	generally	valid	for	the	vast
majority	of	participants.	So	how	does	a	trader	who	is	not	on	the	inside	win	so	big
in	a	game	where	the	odds	are	stacked	against	an	outsider?	That	is	Neumann’s
story.

Neumann	picked	me	up	at	the	airport,	spotting	me	almost	immediately	after	I
exited	 the	 terminal	 door	 (recognizing	 me	 from	 an	 old	 book	 cover	 photo	 I
assume).	We	conducted	the	interview	in	a	sheltered,	open-walled	seating	area	in
his	large	backyard,	which	provided	protection	from	the	intermittent	afternoon
rains.	We	stopped	to	take	a	break	for	dinner	at	a	local	sushi	place.	Neumann	gave
me	a	choice	between	an	Uber	and	walking	via	a	network	of	neighborhood	trails.
I	eagerly	chose	the	latter,	happy	to	get	in	a	small	exercise	fix	after	a	full	day	of
sitting.	 I	 am	 always	 prepared	 to	 record	 dinner	 conversation	 when	 I	 am
interviewing	someone	for	a	book.	By	experience,	I	know	that	sometimes	the	best
stories	come	up	in	the	relaxed	setting	of	a	meal.	Although	the	food	was	excellent
—so	good	that	my	request	for	soy	sauce	and	wasabi	proved	unnecessary,	as	it
would	have	interfered	with	the	subtle	flavorings	of	each	sushi	plate—the	decibel
level	of	the	restaurant	was	competitive	with	the	New	York	subway	system.	I
immediately	 abandoned	 any	 thoughts	 of	 recording	 our	 conversation	 and	 was
careful	to	make	sure	that	our	discussions	steered	well	clear	of	anything	to	do
with	trading.

We	 completed	 the	 interview	 in	 the	 guesthouse	 I	 was	 staying	 at,	 which	 also


houses	Neumann’s	office.	After	a	couple	of	hours,	I	could	see	Neumann	was
flagging—he	is	obviously	a	morning	person,	whereas	I	am	a	night	owl—and	I
could	 tell	 I	 was	 not	 capturing	 any	 additional	 usable	 material.	 I	 ended	 the
interview,	much	to	Neumann’s	relief,	I	suspect.	We	walked	over	to	Neumann’s
office,	where	he	checked	some	stock	charts	on	a	large	monitor.	While	I	stood	at
his	 side,	 he	 brought	 up	 charts	 of	 the	 stock	 trades	 we	 had	 discussed	 that	 day,
showing	 me	 where	 he	 had	 gotten	 in	 and	 out.	 As	 will	 become	 evident	 in	 the
interview,	sector	themes	are	an	essential	component	of	Neumann’s	methodology.
Neumann	defines	his	own	niche	sectors.	As	I	stood	there,	he	read	an	eclectic	mix
of	 names	 off	 of	 the	 tabs	 for	 these	 mostly	 self-defined	 sectors:	 Lithium,	 pot,
cobalt,	graphite,	alt	energy,	robotics,	homeland	security,	homebuilders,	genetic
testing,	wearables,	agriculture,	shipping.

**Did	you	have	any	inkling	at	all	what	you	wanted	to	do	when	you	were	a	kid?**

From	the	youngest	age	I	can	remember,	I	was	going	to	be	a	doctor.	My	dad	was
a	doctor.	To	me,	it	seemed	that	the	successful	people	in	town	were	doctors,	and	I
had	the	compassion	side	as	well.	So	it	seemed	like	a	good	fit.

**Were	you	premed	in	college?**

Yes.	 I	 majored	 in	 chemistry	 and	 minored	 in	 biology.	 I	 finished	 my	 required
coursework	in	three	years.	The	summer	after	my	junior	year,	I	went	backpacking
in	Europe.	It	was	the	first	time	I	had	traveled	in	my	life.	That	trip	opened	my
eyes.	I	had	so	much	fun,	and	I	decided	I	didn’t	want	to	go	to	school	anymore.

**Did	you	go	back	to	college,	or	did	you	get	your	degree	after	three	years?**

I	 could	 have	 graduated	 after	 three	 years,	 but	 I	 left	 myself	 shy	 a	 few	 credits
because	I	knew	I	wasn’t	ready	to	go	on.	I	didn’t	know	what	I	wanted	to	do.	I
finished	my	senior	year,	but	the	only	course	I	took	was	scuba	diving.

**When	did	you	first	become	interested	or	even	aware	of	markets?**

I	had	an	economics	course	in	high	school,	and	as	part	of	the	course,	we	had	a
$100,000	virtual	stock	portfolio.	This	course	was	right	when	the	internet	was
becoming	 available	 in	 school,	 and	 I	 found	 a	 way	 to	 check	 the	 pre-opening
market	prices,	so	I	could	identify	which	stocks	to	buy	from	the	day	before.	I
discovered	this	glitch	in	the	game	early	on.	I	turned	the	$100,000	into	something
like	$1	million.

**So,	essentially,	you	gamed	the	system.**


Completely.

**When	did	you	first	start	trading?**

I	started	trading	stocks	in	my	college	senior	year	at	the	computer	lab	because	I
didn’t	own	a	computer.

**What	was	the	motivation	to	start	trading?**

To	escape	med	school.	To	escape	more	education.

**After	your	summer	backpacking	trip	in	Europe,	were	you	drawn	to	trading
because	you	thought	it	was	an	easy	way	to	make	a	lot	of	money?**

Basically,	yes.

**Did	you	know	anything?	Had	you	done	any	reading	on	trading	or	markets?**

Nothing.	 I	 didn’t	 read	 anything	 about	 business,	 speculating,	 or	 statistics	 until
after	I	started	trading	stocks.

**Then	how	did	you	decide	what	stock	to	buy	and	when	to	buy	it?**

I	 started	 randomly	 looking	 at	 charts,	 and	 I	 found	 a	 stock	 that	 was	 trading
between	seven	and	eight	cents	and	hadn’t	moved	for	a	year.

**Were	you	drawn	to	penny	stocks	because	they	were	cheap?**

Because	 they	 were	 cheap,	 and	 when	 they	 moved,	 they	 moved	 by	 a	 large
percentage.	When	I	looked	at	the	biggest	gainers	on	any	day,	they	were	always
penny	stocks.

**How	much	money	did	you	have	in	your	trading	account?**

Early	in	the	fall,	I	was	caught	in	a	hailstorm	while	driving,	and	I	received	a
$2,500	check	from	the	insurance	company.	I	used	that	money	to	open	my	trading
account.	One	of	the	best	things	I	did	was	to	set	a	profit	goal.	I	saw	that	if	I	could
make	3%	a	day,	I	could	run	up	my	account	to	$1	million	in	under	a	year.

**That	sounds	so	incredibly	naïve.**

Yes,	 so	 naïve.	 I	 totally	 agree.	 I	 don’t	 know	 if	 I	 just	 got	 lucky	 in	 choosing	 a
broker	that	went	out	beyond	the	penny	decimal	in	the	orders	they	accepted.	I
started	trading	not	too	long	after	the	change	from	eighths	and	sixteenths	to	penny
decimals.	 My	 broker	 went	 out	 two	 decimals	 beyond	 the	 penny	 decimal.
However,	most	brokers	at	the	time	only	went	out	to	a	penny,	which	is	why	my
first	stock	never	moved;	it	was	stuck	between	seven	and	eight	cents.

**You	mean	it	was	seven	cents	bid	and	eight	cents	asked.**

Yes,	it	was	something	like	1	million	shares	bid	at	seven	cents	and	1.5	million
shares	offered	at	eight	cents.


**So	they	didn’t	take	any	orders	in	between?**

My	broker	did.	They	let	me	put	in	an	order	at	7.01	cents.	So	I	would	get	filled
anytime	anybody	sold.	I	was	able	to	cut	in	line.	When	I	got	filled,	I	would	put	up
my	stock	for	sale	at	7.99,	and	anytime	anybody	bought,	I	would	get	filled.	I	was
almost	a	market	maker.	So	even	though	my	stock	never	moved—it	was	stuck
between	seven	and	eight	cents—I	was	making	about	13%	after	commission	on
every	trade.

**Did	you	set	any	stop	on	the	trade?**

I	never	set	stops,	but	if	there	ever	was	large	volume	hitting	below	my	entry,	say
at	seven	cents,	in	this	case,	I	was	able	to	get	out.	So	my	loss	would	only	be	.01
cents.

**So	using	this	trade	as	an	example,	would	you	always	get	out	at	seven	cents?**

Yes,	if	it	traded	at	substantial	volume	at	that	price.

**So	even	though	you	were	a	beginner	who	didn’t	know	much	about	trading,
you	were	doing	something	smart:	You	were	putting	on	highly	asymmetric
trades.**

From	 my	 first	 trade,	 I	 thought,	 “I	 could	 make	 a	 living	 at	 this.”	 I	 started	 out
making	hundreds	of	dollars	a	day,	and	before	I	knew	it,	I	was	making	thousands
of	dollars	a	day	doing	the	same	thing.	I	wrote	down	the	account	equity	levels	I
needed	to	reach	each	successive	trading	day	to	get	to	$1	million.	Some	days
when	I	did	really	well,	I	could	cross	off	five	days	at	a	time.	At	one	point,	I
remember	thinking,	“I’m	only	a	hundred	days	away	from	getting	to	$1	million.”
Granted,	I	still	had	to	make	over	$900,000	to	get	there,	but	the	goal	seemed
attainable.

**How	long	did	it	take	you	to	get	to	$1	million?**

I	 don’t	 remember	 exactly,	 but	 not	 much	 longer	 than	 a	 year.	 I	 made	 over	 $1
million	before	I	understood	trading	at	all.	I	just	had	this	one	system	down.	I	was
23,	and	I	had	made	$1	million.	I	thought	I	was	going	to	retire.	I	was	cheap,	and	I
had	virtually	no	expenses.	I	was	eating	Ramen	noodles.	My	entire	trip	to	Europe
the	summer	before	had	cost	me	only	$1,500—and	that	was	including	the	flight.
Interest	rates	at	the	time	were	around	6%,	which	meant	I	could	make	$60,000	a
year	interest	on	a	million	dollars.	That	was	more	than	enough	for	me	to	live	on
after	paying	taxes.

**So	you	planned	to	retire	when	you	got	to	$1	million?**

Basically,	at	that	point,	I	thought	I	would	travel	forever.


**During	this	time,	when	you	were	making	your	first	million,	did	you	look	at
charts	at	all,	or	were	charts	irrelevant	to	what	you	were	doing?**

I	just	used	charts	to	find	stocks	that	didn’t	move—stocks	that	stayed	in	the	same
bid-ask	range	for	a	long	time.	That	way,	I	could	keep	on	putting	on	the	same
trade	over	and	over.

**Was	this	market-making	type	of	trade	the	only	trade	you	were	doing?**

Yeah,	except	one	time,	I	didn’t.	I	bought	a	stock	that	went	from	20	cents	to	$2.00
in	a	matter	of	weeks.	I	started	to	believe	that	I	was	a	stock	trader.	The	stock	had
a	really	cool	story.	It	was	an	animal	tracking	company,	and	I	think	this	was	the
time	when	there	was	a	swine	flu	breakout.	It	was	the	first	time	I	fell	for	a	story.
After	I	bought	it,	the	stock	started	to	break	sharply.

**How	long	after	you	bought	it	did	the	stock	start	tanking?**

Almost	instantly.	The	stock	went	from	$2.00	to	$1.00	in,	literally,	a	matter	of
minutes.	I	remember	breaking	out	into	a	cold	sweat	and	thinking,	“I	had	such	a
good	strategy	going,	and	I	veered	from	it	one	time,	and	I	get	blown	up.”	I	waited
and	got	out	on	a	bounce,	but	I	still	lost	about	30%	of	my	account	on	that	one
trade.

**How	long	did	you	hold	it	before	you	got	out?**

I	got	out	the	same	day.

**Did	you	go	back	to	your	market-making	type	trades?**

Yes,	that	was	all	I	did.

**Did	you	always	place	your	buy	order	.01	cents	above	the	rounded	cent	bid?**

It	started	that	way,	but	then	other	people	began	to	catch	on	and	do	the	same
thing,	and	I	had	to	raise	my	buy	and	lower	my	sell	points	to	levels	where	I	would
get	filled.

**When	did	that	game	end?**

It	ended	about	a	year	after	it	started.	The	bid-asked	spread	got	so	compressed
that	by	the	end,	I	was	selling	a	stock	only	a	few	hundredths	of	a	penny	above
where	I	bought	it.

**Where	did	you	go	from	there?**

I	was	able	to	use	my	software	program	to	build	in	a	ticker	tape	at	the	bottom	of
the	 screen	 that	 only	 showed	 the	 stocks	 that	 I	 was	 interested	 in	 following.	 I
watched	for	stocks	that	had	large	block	size	orders,	so	I	could	follow	what	big
money	was	doing.	I	only	wanted	to	be	in	stocks	where	I	saw	accumulation	by
larger	entities.


**How	did	you	decide	when	to	buy	a	stock?**

I	started	using	technical	analysis.

**Where	did	you	learn	technical	analysis?**

I	just	spent	a	lot	of	time	looking	at	charts.	At	that	point,	I	hadn’t	read	any	books
on	it.	I	looked	at	charts	that	had	made	big	moves.	Why	did	a	stock	launch	off	a
particular	point?	Was	there	a	volume	spike	beforehand?	I	came	up	with	the	most
simple	trendline	analysis	ever—I	still	use	it.

**Which	is	what?**

I	look	for	a	steady	downtrend,	and	I	draw	a	line	connecting	the	spikes.

**How	is	that	different	from	a	conventional	trendline?**

A	lot	of	the	advice	I	have	seen	about	trendline	breakouts	talks	about	breakouts
above	a	flat	line.	I	felt	using	my	trendline	got	me	in	early	and	gave	me	a	head
start.

[Neumann	 is	 actually	 describing	 a	 breakout	 above	 the	 horizontal	 line	 of	 a
sideways	consolidation,	not	a	breakout	from	a	downtrend	line.	Neumann	is	not
using	 a	 different	 type	 of	 trendline,	 as	 might	 be	 inferred	 from	 his	 comments.
Instead,	Neumann	is	making	the	distinction	that	he	is	buying	a	breakout	from	a
downtrend	line	rather	than	an	upside	breakout	from	a	sideways	consolidation
formed	near	lows.	By	definition,	the	latter	price	signal	would	occur	at	a	higher
price.]

I	wanted	to	be	the	guy	who	was	buying	a	stock	right	when	it’s	breaking	out
above	that	downtrend	line.	Often	when	prices	would	compress	at	the	downtrend
line,	there	would	be	large	amounts	offered.	Let’s	say	there	were	100,000	shares
for	sale	at	31	cents;	I	would	try	to	be	the	guy	who	was	buying	the	last	10,000
shares.

**What	if	there	was	no	follow-through?**

That	would	be	a	negative.	The	stock	should	be	moving	like	that	[he	snaps	his
fingers].	You	usually	know	right	away	if	the	trade	is	right.

**So	if	the	trade	isn’t	right	immediately,	you	get	out.**

Yes,	and	I	get	out	really	quickly.	If	I	bought	the	stock	at	30.1	cents,	and	it	went
down	to	30.0	cents,	I	would	hit	the	bid	and	be	out.

**Where	would	you	get	out	if	the	stock	followed	through	on	the	upside?**

Back	then,	I	sold	half	right	away	at	the	first	blip	up,	which	now	is	where	I	start
buying	more,	and	then	if	it	consolidated	and	moved	up,	I	would	sell	the	second


half.

**What	time	frame	were	you	using	for	a	trendline?**

At	that	time,	I	liked	one-month	trendlines	because	I	wanted	to	be	in	and	out	on
the	same	day.	For	me,	a	one-month	trendline	breakout	means	that	the	potential
move	 is	 maybe	 six	 to	 eight	 hours	 long.	 I	 didn’t	 learn	 until	 later	 to	 look	 for
breakouts	from	longer-term	trendlines	because	they	led	to	much	bigger	moves.

**What	do	you	look	for	now?**

I	look	for	breakouts	from	one-	to	five-year	trendlines	so	that	I	can	accumulate
more	significant	positions	and	trade	for	bigger	price	moves.

**When	did	you	shift	from	trading	to	capture	the	next	short-term	price	swing
to	trading	from	a	longer-term	perspective?**

The	first	time	I	got	into	trading	the	way	I	am	doing	it	now	was	when	I	followed	a
recommendation	posted	in	a	chat	room	by	this	great	researcher	named	songw.	He
posted	a	news	article	that	there	was	going	to	be	a	bill	to	increase	the	amount	of
ethanol	in	gasoline	blend	from	1%	to	5%.	I	remember	the	immediate	response	in
the	chat	room	was	people	saying	it	was	no	big	deal	that	the	gasoline	percentage
was	 going	 from	 99%	 to	 95%.	 Songw	 immediately	 reframed	 the	 story	 by
emphasizing	that	for	ethanol,	it	was	a	400%	increase.	It	clicked	for	me.	I	realized
that	it	was	a	big	deal.	We	knew	that	this	bill	was	going	to	come	through,	so	I
loaded	up	on	ethanol	stocks.

**Hadn’t	these	stocks	already	reacted	to	the	news?**

This	post	was	two	weeks	before	the	bill	was	introduced	in	Congress.	The	story
was	carried	in	some	local	Kansas	City	newspaper.	The	news	had	not	yet	been
disseminated	 on	 national	 media.	 It	 was	 just	 that	 songw	 was	 such	 a	 great
researcher	that	he	found	this	story.	Eventually,	the	news	started	getting	picked	up
by	mainstream	media,	and	you	could	see	the	upward	waves	in	prices	as	the	news
became	more	and	more	widely	distributed.

**Was	this	the	first	time	you	held	a	position	for	a	while?**

Yeah.

**How	long	did	you	hold	the	ethanol	stocks?**

I	held	them	for	the	full	move.	I	sold	the	day	the	bill	went	to	Congress.	I	crushed
it.	Three	of	the	ethanol	stocks	I	bought	went	up	over	1000%	in	10	trading	days.	I
think	I	made	more	money	on	this	one	combined	trade	in	two	weeks	than	I	had
made	on	all	my	trades	up	to	that	point.	That	was	the	first	time	I	saw	the	power	of
a	sector	move	with	a	hard	catalyst	and	a	well-defined	date.	I	realized	these	were


the	 types	 of	 trades	 you	 could	 put	 on	 with	 high	 conviction	 and	 achieve	 large
jumps	in	your	account.

**So	these	stocks	topped	when	the	bill	went	to	Congress.**

It’s	 amazing	 how	 catalysts	 are	 over	 the	 second	 the	 public	 believes	 it	 is	 the
beginning.

**Did	this	trade	change	the	way	you	trade?**

It	did.	It	was	the	first	time	this	sector-trading	concept	clicked	for	me.	Before
then,	I	was	trading	these	one-off	stocks,	without	any	idea	why	I	was	buying	the
stock	other	than	because	of	some	zigs	and	zags	on	the	chart.	I	saw	this	crystal-
clear	catalyst	and	the	price	move	that	resulted.	It	changed	my	career.	It	is	how	I
trade	everything	now.	I	like	to	buy	a	whole	sector	of	stocks	at	the	same	time.
When	I	get	into	a	sector,	I	use	a	shotgun	approach.	I	buy	everything	in	the	space
—every	stock,	every	related	stock.	Initially,	I	buy	smaller	positions,	and	then	I
start	researching	the	idea	intensively.	I	read	filings	on	all	the	companies.	Once	I
get	conviction	on	the	trade,	I	start	pyramiding	my	positions	by	hundreds	or	even
thousands	 of	 times.	 Initially,	 I	 might	 have	 a	 position	 as	 small	 as	 a	 thousand
dollars	in	a	stock	so	that	I	am	watching	it.	However,	once	I	am	in	love	with	the
idea,	I’ll	bet	millions	on	it.

**Do	you	still	participate	in	this	chat	room?**

No,	I	left	it	about	five	years	ago.

**Why?**

I	don’t	like	other	people’s	input	anymore.	I	don’t	want	my	ideas	filtered	through
someone	else’s	lens.	Also,	a	chat	room	is	the	trader’s	water	cooler.

**Besides	looking	for	a	catalyst	and	focusing	on	sector	trades,	how	else	has
your	trading	approach	changed	from	the	earlier	years?**

At	this	point,	I	don’t	just	sit	here	and	look	at	a	company.	I	will	visit	the	company.
If	they	make	a	consumer	product,	I	will	buy	it	and	see	if	I	like	it.	If	I	don’t	like
the	product,	I	won’t	trade	the	company.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example?**

A	few	years	ago,	I	started	hearing	about	3D	printing,	so	I	spent	$10,000	and
bought	four	3D	printers.	I	taught	myself	CAD	so	that	I	could	print	out	things	that
I	wanted.	I	printed	out	pegs	for	a	turtle	house	I	designed.	[Neumann	has	a	large
pet	turtle	that	roams	(ever	so	slowly)	his	backyard.]	I	wanted	to	know	which	3D
printer	 was	 the	 best	 and	 why.	 I	 not	 only	 listened	 to	 shareholder	 calls,	 but	 I
attended	 3D	 printing	 conferences.	 Learning	 enough	 about	 3D	 printing	 to


understand	 what	 these	 companies	 were	 doing	 and	 being	 surrounded	 by	 3D
printers	helped	 me	get	 positioned	 in	these	 stocks	before	 they	 took	off.	 I	 turn
myself	into	an	expert	in	each	of	the	sectors	I	invest	in.

**Once	you	decide	you	like	a	sector,	how	do	you	decide	where	to	get	in?**

In	the	case	of	3D	printing,	the	stocks	had	already	started	moving	up,	so	there
were	no	downtrend	line	breakouts	to	use	as	entry	signals.

**What	do	you	do	then?**

There	I	had	to	use	a	30-day	downtrend	or	a	30-day	flat	line.

**So	you	are	talking	about	breakouts	from	shorter-term	consolidations.**

Exactly.

**How	do	you	decide	where	to	get	out?**

It	all	depends.	It	depends	on	the	significance	of	the	catalyst	and	the	strength	of
the	 sector.	 I	 don’t	 have	 any	 preset	 formulas	 or	 rules	 where	 I	 get	 out.	 For
example,	I	don’t	get	out	when	I’m	ahead	10%	or	anything	like	that.

**Using	3D	printers	as	an	example,	how	did	you	decide	where	to	get	out	of
those	stocks?**

The	leader	in	the	space,	3D	Systems,	had	gone	from	$10	to	almost	$100	in	just
over	a	year.	I	was	no	longer	one	of	the	only	guys	at	shareholder	meetings.	There
was	lots	of	talk	about	3D	printing	stocks	in	the	chat	rooms	and	CNBC.	Once
everyone	is	talking	about	it,	I	no	longer	have	an	advantage.	By	that	point,	if	I	am
not	already	out,	I	want	to	be	looking	for	a	place	to	get	out.

**Did	you	wait	for	the	market	to	break	down,	or	did	you	just	get	out?**

Analogous	to	the	downtrend	line	that	I	draw	to	help	me	decide	where	to	get	into
stocks,	I	draw	an	uptrend	line	to	help	me	get	out.	When	the	sector	leaders	broke
their	uptrend	lines,	even	though	some	of	the	smaller	stocks	held	on,	I	started
getting	out	of	everything.

One	other	thing	I	should	mention	is	that	the	3D	printing	experience	led	me	into
what	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 my	 most	 profitable	 trade	 ever.	 I	 found	 a	 3D	 printing
company	that	was	doing	bioprinting.	The	company,	Organovo,	would	take	cells
from	a	person,	grow	them	into	a	huge	number,	and	place	them	into	a	3D	printer
to	 form	 them	 into	 different	 shapes.	 When	 cells	 are	 placed	 into	 different	 3D
shapes,	they	react	differently	than	when	they	are	in	a	flat	plane.	The	goal	was	to
use	this	technique	to	determine	what	kind	of	drugs	might	work	best	for	a	specific
person.	I	started	buying	the	company	as	soon	as	I	heard	about	it,	which	was
about	two	months	after	they	were	listed	on	the	OTC.	The	market	cap	at	the	time


was	probably	only	about	$40	million.	As	I	was	making	money	in	the	3D	printing
stocks,	literally,	every	day,	I	would	buy	more	Organovo	stock,	as	my	conviction
level	grew.

I	compare	trading	to	a	puzzle	that	needs	to	be	filled	in.	The	number	of	pieces	in
the	puzzle	were	growing—other	3D	printing	stocks	were	moving	higher,	which
was	a	big	part	of	the	puzzle	for	me,	and	volume	in	the	stock	was	rising.	I	visited
the	CEO,	who	was	also	the	founder,	and	I	could	see	his	sheer	enthusiasm	about
the	company.	I	met	the	original	angel	investor.	I	got	to	see	their	3D	bioprinter	in
action.	Then	they	uplisted	to	the	NASDAQ	and	did	a	concurrent	share	filing
raise,	 which	 knocked	 the	 price	 of	 the	 stock	 down	 about	 30%.	 But	 from	 my
perspective,	the	uplisting	provided	the	ultimate	buying	opportunity,	and	I	went
all	in.	At	my	peak,	I	probably	owned	3%	or	4%	of	the	company.	At	the	time,
Organovo	 was	 at	 $3.50,	 and	 within	 a	 year,	 it	 went	 to	 $12,	 which	 is	 where	 I
liquidated	most	of	my	position.	That	was	the	year	I	made	$10	million.

**What	happened	to	Organovo	after	you	got	out?**

It	went	slightly	higher	before	it	started	going	down.	Now	it’s	back	to	around	$1.

**So	after	a	massive	rally,	it	went	all	the	way	back	down.	Was	that	true	of	the
3D	printing	sector	as	a	whole?**

Yes,	the	stocks	got	smashed.	They	ended	up	going	all	the	way	back	down	again
as	well.

**Any	other	trades	that	stand	out	in	your	mind?**

For	a	lot	of	my	best	trades,	the	stocks	don’t	even	exist	anymore.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example?**

One	day	back	in	2009,	I	noticed	that	this	one-penny	stock	called	Spongetech
traded	200	million	shares	in	one	day.	I	checked	the	insider	trading	filings	and
discovered	insiders	had	recently	bought	750	million	shares	at	7/10	of	one	cent—
an	amount	equal	to	half	of	all	the	outstanding	shares!	I	checked	into	what	the
company	did	and	found	that	they	made	a	sponge	with	the	soap	built	into	it.	I
thought	to	myself,	“OK,	this	is	mildly	interesting.”	I	ordered	the	product	and
tried	it,	and	I	actually	liked	it.	However,	the	biggest	thing	for	me	was	the	filing
that	showed	that	insiders	had	bought	half	the	outstanding	shares.	So	I	bought
something	like	six	or	seven	million	shares.

**Where	did	you	get	in?**

I	 got	 in	 between	 one	 and	 two	 cents.	 The	 company	 then	 went	 on	 a	 massive
advertising	campaign.	They	sponsored	a	program	on	HBO	about	football	called


_Hard	Knocks_ .	Every	time	you	saw	a	player,	they	had	a	Spongetech	logo	on	their
jersey.	 They	 sponsored	 the	 Home	 Run	 Derby	 and	 had	 this	 huge	 Spongetech
banner.	They	sponsored	the	US	Open	women’s	tennis	tournament,	and	they	had
this	visual	of	the	Spongetech	logo	at	center	court	that	you	could	only	see	on	TV.
These	 guys	 were	 everywhere.	 They	 started	 selling	 in	 Walgreens	 and	 CVS.	 I
decided	to	stay	with	my	position	and	wait	to	see	how	big	this	company	could
get.

One	day,	after	the	stock	had	gone	up	to	ten	cents,	I	was	at	the	bar	with	a	few	of
my	friends,	and	they	were	talking	about	Spongetech.	They	were	cultish	about	it,
and	these	are	not	stock	trading	friends.	They	had	found	the	stock	too,	maybe
through	all	the	sports	advertising.	The	stock	price	just	kept	on	going	up.

I	travel	every	summer,	and	that	summer,	I	decided	to	hold	onto	the	Spongetech
position	during	my	travels.	It	was	the	only	position	I	had	on.	Every	penny	up,	I
would	sell	100,000	shares.	While	I	was	on	safari	in	Kenya,	I	received	a	text	from
my	buddy	telling	me	that	Spongetech	had	gone	up	to	25	cents.	At	25	cents,	the
company’s	market	capitalization	was	nearing	$400	million,	and	all	they	did	was
make	a	sponge	with	soap.	I	was	in	a	panic.

**Since	you	had	been	selling	on	the	way	up,	how	much	of	the	position	did	you
still	have	left?**

I	still	had	over	half	the	position—several	million	shares.	I	was	in	a	tent	camp	in
Kenya,	and	I	didn’t	have	a	computer	or	phone	access.

**How	were	you	able	to	get	text	messages	if	you	had	no	phone	access?**

I	 had	 a	 BlackBerry,	 and	 you	 could	 get	 text	 messages	 from	 other	 BlackBerry
users.	There	might	have	been	some	way	to	make	an	international	call,	but	I	had
no	idea	how	to	do	it.	So	I	bribed	the	lady	at	the	reception	desk	to	use	their	dial-
up	computer,	which	was	so	slow	that	it	took	me	several	minutes	to	get	each	trade
through.	By	the	time	I	got	my	last	order	in,	the	stock	price	had	climbed	to	28
cents.	 After	 I	 was	 back	 in	 my	 tent,	 my	 buddy	 sent	 me	 a	 frantic	 text	 saying,
“Spongetech	is	down	to	five	cents!	What	do	I	do?”

**The	same	day!**

Yes,	literally	five	minutes	after	I	got	back	to	my	tent.

**What	did	you	tell	your	friend?**

I	had	texted	him	that	I	was	selling	my	position	while	I	was	getting	out.	When	he
texted	me	back	later	saying	that	the	stock	price	was	down	to	five	cents,	I	was	at	a
loss	for	words.


**Had	you	been	following	the	stock	while	you	were	traveling?**

Periodically.	I	was	pretty	comfortable	with	the	position.

**When	was	the	last	time	you	had	checked	on	the	price	before	you	received
your	friend’s	text?**

It	was	probably	several	days	earlier.

**So	if	you	didn’t	get	the	text,	or	if	you	had	been	several	minutes	slower	in
getting	your	orders	through,	you	would	have	given	back	almost	all	your
profits	on	the	remaining	position.**

Yes,	that	was	probably	a	$700,000	text	message.

**What	had	caused	the	abrupt,	enormous	crash	in	the	stock	price?**

To	 me,	 it	 seemed	 to	 be	 like	 a	 play	 straight	 out	 of	 _Reminiscences	of	a	Stock
Operator_ .	 [This	 classic	 book	 on	 speculation,	 whose	 protagonist	 is	 widely
assumed	to	be	Jesse	Livermore,	is	set	in	the	financial	backdrop	of	an	age	replete
with	bucket	shops	and	market	manipulation.]	The	insiders	owned	750	million
shares.	Two	months	earlier,	they	couldn’t	even	have	sold	100	million	shares	at
one	penny.	However,	if	they	could	generate	tons	of	publicity	and	get	the	price
way	above	10	cents	so	that	10	cents	looked	good,	then	they	could	sell	the	entire
750	million	shares	at	10	cents	easily.	I’m	sure	what	happened	that	day	is	that	the
insiders	started	selling	out	their	position,	and	as	prices	began	to	collapse,	they
kept	on	selling	until	they	couldn’t	sell	any	more.

[In	2010,	the	SEC	charged	Spongetech	and	its	executives	with	“a	massive	pump-
and-dump	scheme	that	deceived	investors	into	believing	they	were	buying	stock
in	 a	 highly	 successful	 company.”	 Spongetech	 had	 also	 defrauded	 Madison
Square	Garden	and	a	host	of	professional	sports	teams,	leaving	them	holding	the
bag	for	millions	of	dollars	of	unpaid	sponsorship	and	advertising	bills.]

**Do	you	also	trade	from	the	short	side?**

I	never	go	short.

**How	then	did	you	manage	to	make	over	$1	million	in	2008	trading	only
from	the	long	side?**

I	feel	like	traveling	has	helped	my	trading	career.	Taking	summers	off	has	been
beneficial	to	my	trading	because	summer	always	seems	like	a	really	tough	time
for	the	markets.	When	I	came	back	in	the	fall	of	2008,	the	world	was	falling
apart.	I	was	fresh	and	ready	to	go.	My	account	was	at	all-time	highs.	I	had	all
sorts	of	new	stocks	to	watch.	I	was	ready	to	catch	a	move,	whereas	people	who
had	 been	 trading	 during	 the	 summer	 were	 completely	 demoralized,	 and	 their


accounts	had	been	beaten	down.

I	 nibbled	 at	 some	 financial	 stocks,	 which	 had	 declined	 particularly	 sharply,
trying	to	pick	a	bottom,	but	I	was	continually	stopped	out.	I	knew	that	at	some
point,	I	was	going	to	make	a	move.	Then	one	day,	you	could	see	something	was
different	in	the	financial	stocks.	There	were	10	minutes	left	in	the	day,	and	I
loaded	up	on	a	whole	basket	of	financial	stocks.

**Why?**

I	saw	the	stocks	breaking	through	their	steep	downtrend	lines	on	high-volume.
Someone	was	buying,	so	I	joined	in.	I	bought	loads	of	equities,	and	I	levered	up
by	buying	a	ton	of	two-week-out	options	on	financial	stocks.	After	the	market
closed,	I	remember	driving	to	play	tennis	with	my	friend,	and	I	heard	a	story	on
the	 radio	 about	 TARP.	 [The	 Troubled	 Asset	 Relief	 Program	 allowed	 the	 US
government	 to	 buy	 up	 to	 $700	 billion	 worth	 of	 illiquid	 assets	 from	 financial
institutions.]	It	was	the	first	time	I	had	heard	the	term.	I	knew	things	were	going
to	be	crazy.	The	next	morning,	all	the	stocks	I	had	bought	were	up	big;	some
were	up	as	much	as	50%	from	where	I	had	bought	them.	Within	five	minutes	of
the	opening,	I	took	profits	on	all	the	positions	I	had	bought	the	previous	day.	I
made	nearly	$900,000	that	day.	I	had	held	these	positions	maybe	a	total	of	15
minutes	 of	 market	 time—10	 minutes	 the	 previous	 day,	 and	 five	 minutes	 that
morning.	[Neumann	had	not	caught	the	market	bottom,	but	only	a	short-term
relative	low.	The	market	continued	to	move	lower	in	subsequent	months,	so	it
was	quite	fortunate	that	he	took	quick	profits.]

**Initially,	you	started	out	trading	penny	stocks.	What	kind	of	stocks	do	you
focus	on	now	that	you	are	trading	tens	of	millions?**

I	still	focus	on	small-cap	stocks.	My	sweet	spot	is	stocks	in	the	$200	million–
$500	million	capitalization	range.

**Why	is	that?**

I	think	that	it	is	much	easier	for	a	company	in	that	size	range	to	have	a	big	price
move.

**Given	your	much	larger	account	size,	do	you	ever	still	trade	penny	stocks—
I	mean	that	literally:	stocks	trading	under	$1?**

Sure,	sometimes,	they	are	my	best	trades.

**Isn’t	liquidity	a	problem?**

Well,	I	break	up	my	orders	into	smaller	trades.	I	also	scale	into	positions	over
time,	sometimes	buying	more	every	day.


**How	about	getting	out?**

If	 I	 pick	 the	 right	 trade,	 and	 the	 stock	 is	 moving	 sharply	 higher,	 excitement
builds,	and	there	tends	to	be	a	substantial	increase	in	liquidity.	By	the	time	I	take
profits,	there	is	usually	good	liquidity	in	the	stock.

**Can	you	give	me	a	recent	example	of	such	a	penny	stock	trade?**

About	two	months	before	CBD	became	legal	at	the	federal	level	(it	was	sort	of
gray-line	legal	within	individual	states	until	the	farm	bill	passed),	I	went	to	a
local	 liquor	 store,	 which	 is	 the	 biggest	 beverage	 store	 in	 Texas.	 I	 asked	 the
manager	of	the	non-alcohol	beverage	section,	“Do	you	have	anything	with	CBD
in	it.”	This	guy	stopped	in	his	tracks	and	said,	“We	have	one	product,	and	this
product	has	changed	my	life	like	nothing	else	before.”	He	was	60	years	old	and
had	suffered	from	arm	pain	issues.	He	would	not	let	me	leave	the	conversation
for	15	or	20	minutes.	I	heard	his	name	paged	on	the	intercom,	but	he	wasn’t
paying	any	attention	to	it.	He	just	kept	telling	me	how	much	he	loved	this	water.
He	got	me	excited	about	the	product.	It	was	four	dollars	for	a	small	bottle,	and	I
bought	a	case.

I	got	home	and	looked	up	the	company.	It	was	a	two-cent	stock,	and	it	was	right
at	the	cusp	of	a	two-year	downtrend	line.	Given	how	excited	the	manager	at	the
store	was	about	the	product	and	with	a	small	bottle	selling	for	four	dollars,	I
figured	the	sales	could	be	outstanding.	I	also	had	my	primary	chart	buy	signal—
a	breakout	from	a	long-term	downtrend	line.	I	bought	a	couple	of	percent	of	the
company.	I	tried	the	product,	and	it	seemed	to	be	working	for	me.

**What	ailment	did	you	have?**

I	had	herniated	a	disc	a	few	years	before,	and	I	was	taking	Aleve	every	day.

**So	this	CBD	water	worked	for	you?**

It	did,	but	it’s	hard	to	know	if	it	was	the	water	or	just	a	placebo	effect.	I	started
going	to	the	store	every	day.	I	wanted	to	see	who	was	buying	the	product.

**Did	the	manager	think	it	was	a	bit	odd	that	you	were	hanging	out	at	the
store	every	day?**

After	the	first	day,	I	told	him	why	I	was	there.	I	told	him	that	I	was	interested	in
the	stock	and	that	I	had	bought	a	bunch	of	other	CBD	stocks	as	well.	He	thought
that	was	cool.	I	got	to	know	the	manager	pretty	well.	I	noticed	the	clerks	were	all
drinking	the	water.

The	stock	started	running	and	went	up	1,000%	from	where	I	had	bought	it	only	a
few	weeks	earlier.	The	stock	hit	25	cents.	I	went	into	the	store	for	my	daily	visit,


and	the	manager	rushed	up	to	me.	His	face	was	white,	and	he	said,	“We	just
pulled	all	the	product.	They	found	something	floating	in	the	water.”	I	said,	“OK.
Are	you	going	to	get	it	back	in?”	He	said,	“We	pulled	all	the	product	from	our
main	warehouse.	We	don’t	know	if	we’ll	ever	carry	it	again.”

I	drove	home	as	fast	as	I	could.	I	got	home,	and	sure	enough,	the	case	I	had
bought	 the	 day	 before	 had	 this	 brown	 stuff	 floating	 in	 it.	 Up	 to	 that	 point,	 I
thought	I	would	be	holding	onto	this	stock	for	a	long	time.	I	started	selling	as
fast	as	I	could.	There	was	unlimited	liquidity	in	the	market.	The	CEO	had	just
given	an	interview	that	morning	in	which	he	said	that	if	the	company	got	their
sales	above	$1	million	for	the	year,	Coca-Cola	might	be	interested	in	buying
them	out.	The	stock	probably	traded	100	million	shares	that	day.	I	had	three	or
four	million	shares	at	that	point,	and	I	was	able	to	sell	my	entire	position	at	the
dead	top	without	moving	the	stock	price	at	all.

**So	 you	 had	 advance	 notice	 of	 the	 product	 being	 pulled	 by	 their	 main
distributor.**

Yeah.	I	wouldn’t	call	it	inside	information,	but	it	was	the	type	of	information	you
get	if	you	are	out	there	looking	for	it.

**What	about	the	other	CBD	stocks	you	had	bought?	Since	the	problem	was
specific	to	this	one	company,	were	the	other	CBD	companies	impacted	as
well?**

They	were	affected	because	I	sold	out	of	everything.	I	was	probably	the	single
biggest	retail	holder	in	these	stocks.

I	stayed	interested	in	the	space,	though.	I	went	to	California	for	a	month	and
turned	myself	into	an	expert	on	CBD	and	THC	stocks.	I	went	to	every	publicly
traded	retail	and	dispensary	chain.	There	was	one	retail	chain	called	MedMen
that	had	a	billion-dollar	capitalization.	I	spent	45	minutes	in	one	of	their	stores.
There	were	20	employees.	One	other	customer	came	in	while	I	was	there,	and	he
bought	a	single	joint.	I	was	thinking	to	myself,	“These	employees	are	probably
making	$15	or	$20	an	hour.	The	store	is	on	prime	real	estate,	which	must	be
expensive	 to	 rent.	 They	 don’t	 make	 the	 product	 they	 sell,	 and	 they’re	 hardly
doing	any	business.	How	can	this	company	be	worth	a	billion	dollars?”	I	didn’t
go	short	because	I	don’t	short	stocks,	but	I	had	been	nibbling	on	the	stock,	and
after	that	store	visit,	I	sold	my	small	position.	I	also	did	a	blog	post	on	the	stock.

**What	eventually	happened	to	the	stock?**

It	went	down	from	over	six	dollars	to	about	two	dollars	in	a	few	months.

**In	almost	all	the	examples	we	discussed,	it	seems	you	focus	on	new	product**


**categories.	Is	that	indeed	an	integral	part	of	your	investment	approach?**

I	like	to	try	new	products	early	on.	Sometimes,	I	can	envision	applications	for	a
new	product	before	they	even	exist.	I	don’t	remember	the	year,	but	I	had	bought
this	biometric	scanner	that	plugged	into	my	laptop	and	allowed	me	to	log	in	with
my	thumbprint.	I	remember	holding	this	dongle	in	one	hand	and	my	iPhone	in
the	other	and	thinking,	“This	is	so	obvious.	Why	doesn’t	my	phone	have	this
capability?”	 Years	 later,	 I	 started	 watching	 AuthenTec,	 a	 biometric	 sensors
technology	company.	When	I	got	my	downtrend	breakout	signal,	I	bought	some.
As	it	moved	higher,	I	kept	adding	to	my	position.	Then	AuthenTec	signed	a	deal
with	Samsung.	My	reaction	was,	“Oh	my	God.	It’s	all	systems	go!”	I	had	never
seen	a	trade	that	was	so	obvious.	I	went	all	in.	I	had	more	than	one-third	of	my
account	in	this	one	stock.

**Literally,	more	than	one-third	of	your	account	in	one	stock!**

Oh	yeah.	I	still	do	that	sometimes.	At	this	point,	my	average	price	was	much
lower.	I	was	just	pyramiding,	filling	out	the	tail	end	of	my	position.	About	two
weeks	after	the	Samsung	deal	was	announced,	Apple	bought	the	company.	That
was	the	only	time	in	my	career	when	a	stock	I	held	was	bought	out.

**When	you	have	more	than	one-third	of	your	entire	account	in	one	stock,
how	do	you	protect	yourself?**

If	the	stock	is	not	acting	right,	I	scale	out	the	same	way	I	scaled	in.

**What	do	you	mean	by	not	acting	right?**

If	the	stock	starts	moving	down	instead	of	up,	or	liquidity	is	declining,	or	big
orders	are	getting	hit	on	the	ask	instead	of	the	bid.	By	the	time	I	buy	several
percent	of	a	company,	I	have	a	pretty	good	idea	of	how	the	stock	acts.	If	the
stock	starts	acting	differently,	I	start	reducing	my	position.

A	long	conversation	ensued	about	cryptocurrencies	and	Neumann’s	positioning
in	this	space.	To	recap	succinctly,	he	got	long	very	early	on	based	on	a	chart
breakout	 and	 held	 a	 core	 position	 throughout	 the	 entire	 giant	 upmove	 that
culminated	in	 late	2017.	 Our	 discussion	turned	 to	why	 he	 decided	to	 get	 out
when	he	did.


**Did	something	change	atmosphere-wise	when	you	decided	to	get	out?**

Yeah.	I	call	it	my	golf	course	indicator.	I	usually	never	talk	markets	with	my	golf
buddies.	 I	 showed	 up	 for	 the	 first	 tee,	 and	 this	 60-year-old	 who	 has	 never
speculated	in	stocks	asked	me	about	Litecoin.	To	me,	that	was	a	clear	sign	that
the	masses	knew	about	this	trade.	By	that	point,	I	had	been	in	this	trade	for	over
a	year.	I	thought	it	was	time	for	me	to	start	looking	to	get	out.

**If	you	get	stopped	out	of	a	trade,	will	you	look	to	reenter	it	if	conditions	are
right?**

It’s	easy	for	me	to	buy	it	again.	I	have	no	qualms	about	buying	higher.

**Did	any	books	influence	the	way	you	trade?**

It	 probably	 took	 more	 than	 a	 year	 of	 trading	 before	 I	 read	 my	 first	 financial
book.

**Which	book?**

_Reminiscences	of	a	Stock	Operator._

**Did	that	book	influence	your	trading,	and	if	so,	how?**

It	 reinforced	 what	 I	 was	 already	 doing—most	 importantly,	 placing	 large	 bets
when	you	had	the	right	set	up,	and	keeping	bets	small	when	you	didn’t.	My
winning	percentage	on	trades	is	way	less	than	50%,	but	I	still	do	well	because	I
can	recognize	the	one	or	two	times	a	year	when	all	the	pieces	of	the	puzzle	are	in
place,	and	I	need	to	bet	big	on	a	trade.

**What	else	did	you	get	out	of	** **_Reminiscences_****?**

There	is	an	anecdote	in	the	book	about	a	time	when	Jesse	Livermore	had	a	giant
position,	and	there	was	a	newspaper	story	publicizing	that	fact.	The	stock	gapped
up	sharply	the	following	day	based	on	that	news,	and	Livermore	took	advantage
of	the	increased	liquidity	to	get	out	of	his	entire	position.	When	I	am	holding	a
penny	stock	or	small-cap	stock,	I	think	of	that	episode	to	remind	myself	that	I
need	to	take	advantage	of	those	times	when	there	is	increased	liquidity	to	take
profits	on	my	position.

**How	would	you	define	your	trading	methodology?**

I	look	at	trading	like	a	puzzle;	I	have	to	get	the	four	corners	in	first.

**What	are	the	four	corners?**

The	first	corner	is	technical	analysis;	you	have	to	have	the	right	chart	pattern.
The	second	corner	is	a	clean	share	structure.

**What	do	you	mean	by	that?**


The	stock	has	few	or	no	options	or	warrants,	and	preferably,	there	are	fewer	than
200	million	shares.

**What	are	the	other	two	corners?**

Being	in	the	right	sector	and	having	a	catalyst	or	story	that	will	make	the	stock
or	sector	move	up.	Once	the	four	corners	are	in	place,	you	can	then	fill	in	the
pieces.

**What	would	those	include?**

Details	on	filings,	checking	into	what	management	has	done	before,	trying	the
product,	and	pyramiding	your	position	correctly.

**What	are	the	trading	rules	you	live	by?**

What’s	next?	Always	look	for	the	next	big	opportunity.	Understand	when	you
get	out	of	a	position	that’s	not	acting	right,	you	can	always	get	right	back	in.
Look	for	10	to	1	return/risk	trading	opportunities.

**What	personal	traits	do	you	have	that	you	believe	have	helped	make	you
successful?**

One	of	the	best	interviews	I’ve	seen	was	with	David	Tepper	after	the	financial
crisis.	 [David	 Tepper	 is	 the	 founder	 of	 Appaloosa	 Management,	 a	 highly
successful	hedge	fund.]	Tepper	made	the	analogy	that	he	was	like	a	wildebeest	in
a	great	migration,	and	he	wanted	to	be	that	first	wildebeest	that	came	into	the
valley	and	could	have	all	the	fresh,	green	grass	he	could	eat.	Sometimes	there
would	be	a	lion	waiting	if	you	are	that	early	on,	and	it	was	a	lot	safer	being	in	the
middle	of	the	pack,	but	then	you	wouldn’t	get	that	fresh,	green	grass	either.	That
comment	really	stuck	with	me.

**Was	that	because	it	described	you?**

It	described	how	I	wanted	to	be	in	the	market.	I	wanted	to	be	first.	Even	if	I	got
smacked	around	sometimes,	it	was	OK,	as	long	as	I	could	be	ahead	of	everyone
else	for	whatever	theme	was	next.

**What	other	traits	have	helped	you	succeed?**

I	am	quick	to	see	when	I	made	a	mistake,	and	I	immediately	pivot	and	correct	it.
I	learn	from	each	mistake.	The	second	I	realize	I	am	wrong	and	get	out	of	the
stock,	it’s	over.	I	don’t	even	remember	the	trade	a	minute	later.	It	happened.	It’s
gone.	I’ve	accepted	it.


Early.	It	came	to	me	in	my	sleep	one	night	while	I	was	working	on	Neumann’s
chapter.	I	hadn’t	realized	it	while	I	was	interviewing	Neumann,	nor	in	the	initial
days	 of	 listening	 to	 my	 interview	 recordings	 and	 working	 on	 this	 chapter.	 A
common	theme	that	underlies	Neumann’s	spectacularly	successful	trading	career
and	 a	 recurrent	 source	 of	 his	 edge	 is	 that	 he	 is	 early.	 When	 NASDAQ
transitioned	from	quoting	prices	in	fractions	to	decimals,	Neumann	was	there	to
take	advantage	of	the	temporary	trading	opportunity	created	as	different	brokers
permitted	orders	with	different	decimal	placement.

In	the	trading	style	Neumann	subsequently	adopted,	he	enters	his	trades	at	the
very	 point	 of	 breakouts	 from	 long	 downtrend	 lines—the	 earliest	 possible
technical	signal	of	a	trend	transition.	Of	course,	this	type	of	entry	point	often
results	in	buying	multiple	false	breakouts	before	a	valid	breakout	occurs.	But
here	again,	Neumann	is	early—he	gets	out	immediately	if	the	breakout	doesn’t
follow	through,	thereby	assuring	a	near-breakeven	outcome,	even	on	premature
trade	entries.

Neumann	is	always	looking	to	get	in	at	the	very	early	stages	of	new	product
sectors,	such	as	3D	printing.	Many	of	these	emerging	industries	go	through	a
cycle	 of	 an	 initial	 upward	 price	 wave,	 as	 hype	 over	 a	 new	 product	 sector
generates	excessive	buying	that	is	unwarranted	by	the	nascent	fundamentals,	and
then	experience	a	near-complete	price	decline	once	reality	sets	in.	Sometimes
these	companies	will	recover,	sometimes	not.	Either	way,	however,	Neumann
seems	to	be	there	to	catch	the	upward	price	movement	stage.

In	talks	I	give	on	the	subject	of	lessons	of	the	Market	Wizards,	I	often	refer	to
the	perspective	of	being	attracted	to	trading	because	“it	is	an	easy	way	to	make	a
lot	 of	 money,”	 as	 an	 illustration	 of	 a	 wrongheaded	 approach.	 Ironically,	 that
perspective	 precisely	 describes	 Neumann’s	 motivation	 to	 start	 trading—and	 it
worked!	I	still	think	that	most	people	who	pursue	trading	as	a	get-rich-quick
endeavor	will	fail,	but	after	interviewing	Neumann,	I	have	to	concede	there	are
some	stark	exceptions	to	this	rule.

Buying	trendline	breakouts	or	anticipated,	imminent	trendline	breakouts	is	an
essential	 component	 of	 Neumann’s	 success.	 Yes,	 by	 itself,	 buying	 trendline
breakouts	is	far	from	a	prescription	for	trading	success.	I	would	even	argue	that
given	 the	 increasingly	 wide	 popularity	 of	 chart	 analysis,	 false	 trendline
breakouts	are	so	frequent	that,	over	the	long	run,	this	technical	signal	is	more
likely	 to	 lead	 to	 net	 losses	 than	 net	 gains,	 let	 alone	 spectacular	 gains.
Nevertheless,	if	you	see	Neumann’s	trade	entries	(after	the	interview,	Neumann


flipped	through	a	series	of	charts	on	his	monitor,	showing	me	where	he	got	into
various	trades),	you	can’t	help	but	be	struck	by	how	incredibly	great	these	trade
entries	 look.	 Chart	 after	 chart,	 his	 entry	 points	 were	 near	 the	 absolute	 low
following	a	prolonged	decline	and	right	before	a	massive,	near-vertical	rally.	The
trade	entries	look	uncanny—almost	as	if	Neumann	had	an	advance	copy	of	the
following	month’s	prices.

So	how	was	Neumann	able	to	use	a	type	of	technical	signal	of	such	questionable
efficacy	 with	 such	 incredible	 effectiveness?	 The	 key	 is	 that	 the	 trendline
breakout	 is	 only	 one	 component	 of	 his	 overall	 strategy.	 By	 itself,	 buying
trendline	breakouts	is	a	loser’s	game.	However,	knowing	 _which_ 	breakouts	to	buy
is	what	makes	Neumann’s	trading	approach	so	effective.	Neumann’s	core	trades
share	many,	if	not	all,	of	the	following	characteristics:

```
The	stock	has	seen	a	large	decline	or	an	extended	sideways	movement	near
lows.
The	 company	 has	 a	 service	 or	 product	 that	 suggests	 considerable	 upside
potential.
There	is	a	catalyst	to	suggest	the	prospect	for	an	imminent	price	rally.
The	stock	is	part	of	a	sector	that	Neumann	has	defined	as	being	primed	for
a	substantial	upward	price	move.
He	is	familiar	with	the	product	and	has	usually	tried	it	himself.
The	stock	is	showing	some	signs	of	life—either	a	sudden	upmove	after	an
extended	period	of	decline	or	sideways	price	movement,	or	an	abrupt	spike
in	volume	after	a	lengthy	period	of	relative	inactivity,	or	both.
```
When	most,	if	not	all,	of	these	elements	are	in	place,	Neumann	is	primed	to	look
for	his	breakout.	So	what	looks	like	a	simple	trade	of	buying	a	downtrend	line
breakout—one	of	the	most	basic	technical	signals	that	can	be	imagined—is	a	far
more	 complex	 trade	 taking	 into	 account	 a	 gamut	 of	 factors	 that	 have	 to	 be
appropriately	lined	up.

There	 is	 another	 essential	 factor	 that	 explains	 how	 Neumann	 can	 be	 so
successful	using	the	mundane	approach	of	trend	breakouts	for	trade	signals,	and
it	has	nothing	to	do	with	trade	entry.	Neumann	buys	a	stock	right	at	the	moment
he	thinks	it	is	ready	to	go	(for	example,	at	the	cusp	of	a	critical	breakout	where
he	is	taking	out	the	last	portion	of	a	large	sell	order).	If	after	Neumann	buys	the


stock,	 it	 fails	 to	 follow	 through	 on	 the	 upside,	 let	 alone	 begins	 to	 drift	 back
down,	Neumann	will	exit	the	trade	immediately.	Because	he	enters	a	trade	at	a
point	at	which	there	is	likely	to	be	at	least	some	minor	follow-through,	even	if
the	 trade	 ends	 up	 being	 wrong,	 Neumann	 can	 typically	 get	 out	 not	 far	 from
breakeven.	So	Neumann’s	phenomenal	track	record	is	not	merely	a	matter	of	a
superior	 trade	 entry	 strategy—although	 he	 certainly	 has	 one—but	 also	 his
unflinching	ability	to	exit	trades	without	hesitation	when	they	are	not	behaving
as	he	expected	them	to.	His	exit	strategy	is	steeped	in	risk	control,	whether	he
thinks	of	it	in	these	terms	or	not.

It	is	fascinating	to	compare	Neumann’s	technical	entry	signal	with	Peter	Brandt’s
(see	Chapter	1).	Neumann	only	wants	to	buy	breakouts	from	downtrend	lines
because	they	will	provide	a	better	entry	price	(when	the	signal	is	valid),	and	he	is
willing	 to	 accept	 the	 greater	 number	 of	 false	 signals	 to	 get	 this	 better	 price.
Brandt	uses	the	exact	opposite	approach:	He	avoids	trendline	breakouts	because
he	considers	them	unreliable.	He	only	wants	to	buy	breakouts	from	horizontal
consolidations	 because	 their	 greater	 reliability	 allows	 for	 the	 placement	 of	 a
protective	stop	that	is	both	meaningful	and	close.	The	two	traders	have	opposite
perspectives	about	technical	trade	entry	signals,	yet	both	are	very	successful—a
classic	 illustration	 of	 the	 principle	 that	 there	 is	 no	 single	 correct	 trading
methodology.

Whereas	 Neumann	 and	 Brandt	 provide	 a	 study	 of	 contrasts	 in	 terms	 of	 trade
entry	 timing,	 it	 is	 noteworthy	 that	 Neumann’s	 trade	 exit	 timing	 is	 the
embodiment	 of	 the	 contrarian	 trading	 philosophy	 expressed	 by	 Jason	 Shapiro
(see	Chapter	2):	“I	try	to	find	out	what	everyone	is	doing,	and	I	do	the	opposite
because	when	everyone	is	in	the	same	trade,	they	lose	money.”	This	sentence
provides	a	good	description	of	how	Neumann	exits	trades.	In	virtually	all	the
major	trades	discussed	in	this	interview,	Neumann	exited	when	the	trade	became
popularized.	Consider	the	following	examples:

```
He	sold	out	of	his	ethanol	stocks	the	day	the	bill	to	increase	the	ethanol
content	in	gasoline	went	to	Congress—a	point	of	peak	media	coverage.
He	liquidated	his	3D	printing	stocks	once	they	become	popular	enough	to
be	the	subject	CNBC	coverage	and	widespread	chat	room	conversations.
He	started	scaling	out	of	his	Spongetech	position	once	it	became	the	topic
of	bar	conversation	among	friends	who	were	not	stock	investors.
He	 liquidated	 his	 cryptocurrency	 holdings	 based	 on	 his	 “golf	 course
```

```

You	 need	 to	 stick	 to	 your	 methodology	 and	 trading	 plan.	 Beware	 of	 being
enamored	by	an	unplanned	trade.	Neumann’s	biggest	loss	(in	percentage	terms)
came	early	in	his	career	when	he	deviated	from	the	market-making	strategy	that
was	generating	steady	returns	to	impulsively	buy	a	stock	that	was	soaring	based
on	a	good	story.	That	one	trade	wiped	out	30%	of	his	account	in	one	day.

It	is	striking	how	many	of	Neumann’s	most	successful	trades	were	dead	wrong
from	a	long-term	perspective.	3D	printer	stocks	and	Organovo	surrendered	their
entire	advance,	ultimately	declining	to	levels	even	lower	than	where	Neumann
had	first	bought	them.	Spongetech	proved	to	be	a	scam	and	became	worthless.
The	point	is	that	what	matters	is	not	what	a	stock	does	long	term,	but	instead
what	 it	 does	 while	 you	 are	 holding	 it.	 Neumann’s	 entry	 and	 exit	 techniques
protected	him	from	any	substantial	loss,	while	still	allowing	him	to	experience
windfall	 gains.	 Successful	 trading	 is	 a	 matter	 of	 skillful	 money	 management
(expressed	via	entry	and	exit	methodologies),	not	prediction.

A	lot	of	Neumann’s	trades	seem	like	pure	luck.	For	example,	his	getting	out	of
the	CBD	water	stock	near	the	absolute	high	because	the	store	clerk	happened	to
tell	him	about	the	impurity	problem.	But	think	about	it:	Neumann	put	himself	in
the	position	to	be	lucky.	It	was	only	because	of	his	on-the-ground	research	and
his	continual	monitoring	of	local	store	sales	that	he	was	in	the	store	to	get	that
valuable	news.	The	BlackBerry	message	he	received	while	on	safari	in	Kenya	on
the	day	Spongetech	made	its	all-time	high	was	a	bit	of	extraordinary	luck.	But	it
was	only	because	Neumann	had	the	right	instincts	to	immediately	liquidate	his
position	during	the	market	buying	hysteria	that	this	message	made	a	difference.

The	Spongetech	trade	also	provides	a	perfect	illustration	of	a	trading	principle
noted	in	 _Hedge	Fund	Market	Wizards_ :	“If	you	are	on	the	right	side	of	euphoria
or	 panic,	 lighten	 up.	 Parabolic	 price	 moves	 in	 either	 direction	 tend	 to	 end
abruptly	and	sharply.	If	you	are	fortunate	enough	to	be	on	the	right	side	of	a
market	in	which	the	price	move	turns	near	vertical,	consider	scaling	out	of	the
position	 while	 the	 trend	 is	 still	 moving	 in	 your	 direction.	 If	 you	 would	 be
petrified	to	be	on	the	other	side	of	the	market,	that	is	probably	a	good	sign	that

you	should	be	lightning	your	position.”^15

Readers	of	Peter	Lynch’s	book _,	One	Up	on	Wall	Street_ , should	find	parts	of	this
interview	 resonate	 strongly	 with	 Lynch’s	 central	 message.	 Specifically,
Neumann’s	 habit	 of	 trying	 out	 new	 products	 and	 visiting	 stores	 to	 see	 how


products	are	selling	are	integral	to	his	trading	success	and	responsible	for	some
of	 his	 best	 trades—getting	 out	 as	 well	 as	 getting	 in.	 Neumann	 is	 the	 living
embodiment	of	Lynch’s	“invest	in	what	you	know”	philosophy.	Neumann	also
focuses	on	seeking	trading	opportunities	that	have	the	potential	to	be	what	Lynch
termed	“ten	baggers”—investments	that	achieve	a	tenfold	price	increase.

Neumann	steps	on	the	gas	when	he	has	a	particularly	high	conviction	on	a	trade.
For	example,	in	the	case	of	AunthenTek,	he	had	between	one-third	to	one-half	of
his	entire	account	in	this	single	position.	This	highly	aggressive	positioning	in
situations	in	which	Neumann	has	firm	conviction	is	a	significant	component	of
the	 tremendous	 compounding	 he	 has	 achieved.	 This	 particular	 aspect	 of
Neumann’s	trading	style,	however,	requires	a	strong	note	of	caution	and	would
be	 dangerous	 for	 most	 traders	 to	 attempt	 to	 follow.	 Extreme	 position
concentration	has	worked	for	Neumann	because	of	three	factors.	First,	he	has	a
high	 success	 rate	 on	 his	 high-conviction	 trades.	 Second,	 he	 scales	 into	 his
positions	so	that	by	the	time	he	has	as	much	as	one-third	of	his	account	in	a
single	 stock	 or	 single	 sector	 play,	 his	 average	 entry	 price	 is	 much	 lower,
providing	him	with	a	substantial	cushion	if	the	stock	starts	falling.	Third,	and
perhaps	 most	 importantly,	 he	 is	 very	 quick	 in	 scaling	 out	 or	 liquidating	 his
position	if	the	stock	starts	moving	down	or	exhibits	other	signs	of	not	acting	as
he	anticipated.	Unless	a	trader	has	similar	skills,	taking	such	large	concentrated
positions	would	be	very	risky	and	expose	the	trader	to	an	account-ending	loss.

# Chris	Camillo: 	Neither

# FOR	the	entire	history	of	market	analysis,	methodologies	could	be	divided	into

either	 being	 fundamental	 or	 technical,	 or	 a	 combination	 of	 the	 two.	 Chris
Camillo’s	 approach	 is	 neither	 fundamental	 nor	 technical.	 His	 methodology
would	have	been	impossible	until	the	modern	era	of	combined	processing	power
and	social	media.	Camillo	has	effectively	created	an	entirely	new	class	of	market
analysis	and	trading—an	approach	he	terms	“social	arbitrage.”

Camillo’s	trading	methodology	developed	as	an	outgrowth	of	observing	social
trends	and	cultural	shifts	in	everyday	life.	To	broaden	his	scope	in	spotting	these
trends,	 Camillo	 founded	 TickerTags,	 a	 company	 whose	 software	 allows
monitoring	 and	 measuring	 social	 media	 mentions	 of	 words	 or	 word
combinations	 (which	 he	 terms	 “tags”)	 that	 are	 important	 to	 specific	 stocks.
Camillo	 describes	 the	 perplexed	 responses	 he	 gets	 when	 he	 explains	 his
methodology.	“People	will	say	to	me,	‘You	mean	you	don’t	even	look	at	PE;	you
don’t	look	at	management;	you	don’t	look	at	price	action.’”	My	response	is,	“I
don’t	look	at	anything	other	than	my	tags.”

To	use	a	visual	metaphor,	Camillo’s	trading	career	could	be	described	as	a	pair
of	islands—one	a	rugged,	desolate	rocky	outcropping,	the	other	a	lush	tropical
paradise—separated	by	a	wide	channel.	Excluding	his	first	trade	as	a	young	teen,
which	is	described	in	detail	in	the	interview,	Camillo’s	initial	foray	into	trading
was	 an	 abject	 failure—years	 of	 multiple	 failed	 methodologies	 and	 a	 steady
depletion	 of	 all	 his	 investment	 assets	 (which	 fortunately	 for	 Camillo	 were
limited	 by	 what	 he	 could	 save	 off	 his	 moderate	 salary).	 After	 a	 decade-long
hiatus,	Camillo	 returned	to	 trading	 in	2006	 and,	in	 stark	 contrast	to	 his	 prior
trading	 effort,	 experienced	 spectacular	 success.	 In	 the	 near-14	 years	 since	 he
resumed	 trading,	 Camillo	 has	 achieved	 a	 68%	 average	 annual	 compounded
return,	turning	his	original	$83,000	stake	into	$21	million,	including	net	cash
withdrawals.

I	initially	met	with	Camillo	when	he	emailed	me	to	request	a	meeting,	seeking
my	advice	on	an	unspecified	matter.	I	replied	that	if	he	wanted	to	fly	to	Boulder
to	meet	in	person	instead	of	a	phone	call,	I	would	accommodate	him.	We	met
over	 a	 long	 brunch	 at	 the	 Buff,	 one	 of	 my	 favorite	 local	 spots.	 Although
Camillo’s	 primary	 vocation	 is	 trading,	 he	 has	 a	 long-running	 interest	 in	 film,
dating	back	to	when	he	wrote	an	unproduced	screenplay	in	college.	He	currently
produces	 a	 YouTube	 series	 called	 _Dumb	Money_ ,	 which	 primarily	 consists	 of


short	videos	in	which	Camillo	and	his	friends	invest	in	local	businesses.	Camillo
explained	that,	at	some	point,	when	he	figures	out	how	to	approach	the	project,
he	would	like	to	do	a	movie	about	trading.	He	wanted	to	know	if	I	would	be
willing	to	participate—in	what	specific	way	he	had	not	yet	determined—and	if	I
had	any	thoughts	about	the	idea.	I	told	Camillo	that	I	thought	the	concept	would
be	challenging	to	execute	because	achieving	an	accurate	depiction	of	trading	and
producing	 an	 engaging	 film	 seemed	 like	 incompatible	 goals.	 Camillo	 hasn’t
figured	it	out	yet	either,	but	he’s	thinking	about	it.

By	the	time	Camillo	and	I	met,	I	had	decided	to	do	another	 _Market	Wizards_
book,	 which	 was	 not	 the	 case	 in	 our	 first	 email	 communication.	 From	 his
introductory	email,	it	sounded	like	Camillo	could	be	a	possible	candidate,	so	I
asked	 him	 to	 send	 me	 his	 monthly	 statements	 if	 he	 had	 an	 interest	 in
participating.	When	we	met	in	Boulder,	I	had	already	decided	I	would	interview
Camillo	for	the	book,	and	I	was	careful	to	avoid	any	discussion	about	his	trading
—a	conversation	I	wanted	to	reserve	totally	for	the	actual	interview.

When	 I	 scheduled	 the	 interview,	 I	 allowed	 for	 an	 eight-hour	 block	 of	 time
because	I	knew	from	our	first	meeting	that	Camillo	was	a	conversationalist,	and
there	would	be	a	lot	of	ground	to	cover.	For	efficiency,	I	scheduled	the	interview
to	coincide	with	a	day	I	was	in	Austin	(Camillo	lives	in	Dallas).	When	I	arrived
at	the	Austin	airport	that	morning,	I	discovered	that	my	flight	was	canceled	due
to	thunderstorms,	as	was	every	other	flight	until	late	that	afternoon.	My	only
recourse	was	to	rent	a	car	for	a	four-hour	drive	through	steady	rain	and	weather-
induced	traffic	jams.	Some	trader	interviews	are	a	chore	because	the	subject	is
tough	to	draw	out,	while	in	other	interviews,	the	conversation	flows	smoothly.
Given	the	stress	of	a	canceled	flight	and	an	energy-sapping	drive,	I	was	fortunate
that	Camillo’s	interview	fell	into	the	latter	category.

I	 interviewed	 Camillo	 in	 a	 covered	 section	 of	 his	 backyard,	 which	 provided
shelter	from	the	steady	rainfall.	We	continued	the	interview	over	dinner	at	a	club
Camillo	belonged	to.	To	avoid	the	restaurant	noise,	which	would	have	made	the
recordings	of	our	conversation	unintelligible,	we	were	served	dinner	privately	in
the	aboveground	“wine	cellar”—an	accommodation	for	which	I	was	profoundly
thankful.

**Where	did	you	get	your	first	awareness	of	markets?**


My	older	brother	was	a	stockbroker.	You	always	look	up	to	your	older	siblings.
So,	I	guess	that	was	my	first	impression	that	trading	was	a	thing.	But	I	really
didn’t	get	interested	in	it	till	I	was	12	or	13	[he	laughs	loudly].	I	was	always
aware	of	knowledge	arbitrage,	and	in	a	way,	I	was	doing	it	from	when	I	was	very
young.

**What	do	you	mean	by	knowledge	arbitrage?**

I	was	obsessed	with	garage	sales	when	I	was	a	kid,	starting	when	I	was	about	12
years	old.	I	would	spend	every	Wednesday	and	Thursday	analyzing	the	garage
sales	in	the	newspaper.	When	I	could,	I	would	go	to	the	houses	before	the	garage
sale	to	inquire	about	what	merchandise	they	were	selling.	I	was	trying	to	find
things	 that	 I	 could	 resell.	 I	 would	 identify	 buyers	 who	 were	 interested	 in	 a
particular	 type	 of	 item.	 I	 had	 a	 guy	 I	 called	 the	 “Fan	 Man,”	 who	 was	 only
interested	in	buying	old	fans.	I	had	another	guy	who	bought	old	watches.

**How	did	you	find	people	who	were	interested	in	one	particular	item?**

I	went	to	antique	malls	and	flea	markets	to	find	people	who	were	interested	in
one	particular	item	and	were	willing	to	pay	a	premium	for	it.	There	was	no	eBay
at	the	time.

**How	could	you	assess	the	quality	of	what	you	were	buying?	If	you	were
buying	an	antique	watch,	how	did	you	know	that	it	wasn’t	a	piece	of	junk?**

I	can’t	say	precisely	how	I	figured	this	out.	Garage	sales	and	estate	sales	are
almost	 exclusively	 managed	 by	 older	 women,	 who	 have	 a	 high	 degree	 of
knowledge	about	items	such	as	apparel,	furniture,	china,	and	antiques,	but	they
have	a	much	lower	degree	of	knowledge	about	things	that	are	male-oriented,
such	as	watches	and	old	train	sets.	Anything	that	was	male-oriented,	they	just
put	a	number	on	it	and	got	rid	of	it.	The	stuff	that	I	was	buying	was	mispriced
because	 the	 sellers	 deemed	 it	 as	 not	 being	 worth	 anything.	 But	 I	 would	 find
someone	interested	in	that	one	particular	item.	I	did	this	for	years	here	in	Dallas,
and	it	became	a	real	obsession.	I	got	the	bug	for—I	don’t	know	what	you	would
call	it—treasure	hunting	or	arbitraging	knowledge.

**As	a	young	teen,	how	did	you	get	to	these	garage	sales?**

I	rode	my	bike	and	took	buses.

**How	much	money	did	you	make	doing	this?**

Some	weekends,	I	didn’t	make	anything.	But	on	a	good	weekend,	I	could	make
$100	or	$200,	which	was	the	world	to	me	at	the	time.	I	also	had	a	car	detailing
business.	I	was	very	entrepreneurial.	I	had	a	30-year-old	mind	in	a	kid’s	body.	I


wasn’t	 doing	 the	 stuff	 I	 should	 have	 been	 doing.	 I	 graduated	 in	 the	 bottom
quarter	of	my	high	school	class.	I	don’t	think	that	was	because	I	wasn’t	as	smart
as	the	other	kids,	but	rather	because	I	had	a	hard	time	focusing	on	things	that
didn’t	interest	me.	School,	at	the	time,	didn’t	interest	me;	making	money	did.	If
it	were	today,	I	would	probably	have	been	diagnosed	with	ADD	[attention	deficit
disorder]	and	put	on	meds.	Back	then,	they	didn’t	do	that.

**How	did	you	go	from	garage	sales	arbitrage	to	trading?**

Every	Friday	and	Saturday	before	I	went	to	my	garage	sales,	I	would	stop	at	a	7-
Eleven	and	buy	a	lemon-flavored	Snapple	iced	tea.	They	always	had	two	full
refrigerators	of	Snapple.	One	morning,	I	went	there,	and	they	had	consolidated
all	 the	 Snapple	 drinks	 to	 one-half	 of	 one	 refrigerator.	 There	 was	 barely	 any
Snapple	left	and	none	of	my	flavor.	I	asked	the	clerk	what	had	happened.	He
explained	 they	 were	 now	 carrying	 a	 more	 limited	 Snapple	 selection	 because
there	were	new	competitors	on	the	market,	such	as	Arizona.

I	came	home	that	day	and	told	my	brother	about	it.	I	asked	him,	“Hey,	is	there
any	 way	 I	 can	 make	 any	 money	 out	 of	 this?”	 He	 said,	 “Yeah,	 we	 can	 short
Snapple	by	buying	puts.”	He	told	me	Snapple’s	earnings	were	a	week	away,	and
he	explained	how	puts	worked.	I	gave	him	$300.	He	bought	Snapple	puts	for	me,
and	 a	 week	 later,	 Snapple	 announced	 they	 were	 building	 up	 inventory	 in	 the
channel,	which	I	didn’t	understand	at	the	time.	But	the	insight	I	had	at	the	7-
Eleven	 was	 correct,	 and	 I	 tripled	 my	 money	 on	 the	 trade.	 It	 was	 a	 magical
moment	for	me,	and,	from	that	point	on,	I	was	hooked.

**How	old	were	you	then?**

About	14.

**Did	you	understand	your	brother’s	explanation	of	what	puts	were?**

Oh	yeah,	I	understood	everything.	What	I	didn’t	recognize	at	the	time	was	how
powerful	the	methodology	I	had	discovered	was.	I	didn’t	realize	that	the	way	I
went	about	figuring	out	that	Snapple	trade	would	ultimately	be	the	methodology
I	 would	 carry	 forward	 in	 my	 investment	 career.	 That	 methodology,	 however,
wouldn’t	come	until	many	years	later.

Here’s	 what	 happened	 with	 my	 subsequent	 trading	 in	 high	 school	 and	 early
college.	It	didn’t	go	well.	I	was	terrible.	I	would	go	from	one	methodology	to
another,	depending	on	which	book	I	had	read	last.	For	example,	one	of	the	books
I	read—I	don’t	remember	the	name—was	about	the	Hunt	brothers	cornering	the
silver	market.	For	a	while,	I	became	obsessed	with	commodities.	There	was	a
store	several	miles	from	my	house	where	you	could	buy	silver.	I	went	there	and


bought	a	100-ounce	silver	bar.	Every	day,	I	would	get	the	newspaper	and	chart
the	price	of	silver.	It	took	me	about	five	months	to	realize	that	I	wasn’t	going	to
make	any	money	in	commodities	[he	laughs	loudly].

**Were	there	any	market	books	that	had	a	positive	impact	on	your	trading?**

Over	 the	 years,	 I	 read	 a	 lot	 of	 market	 books,	 but	 only	 one	 had	 a	 significant
impact	on	me:	 _One	Up	on	Wall	Street_ 	by	Peter	Lynch.

**Actually,	your	Snapple	trade	could	be	a	poster	child	for	the	theme	of	that
book.**

It	 really	 could.	 The	 book	 resonated	 with	 me	 and	 had	 a	 major	 impact	 on	 my
thinking	about	how	I	could	successfully	invest.	It	gave	me	the	confidence	that
what	I	did	in	the	Snapple	trade	wasn’t	just	luck.	If	it	weren’t	for	reading	Lynch’s
book,	I	would	have	thought,	“You	can’t	beat	the	smartest	minds	on	Wall	Street
by	 just	 walking	 through	 a	 store.”	 I	 wasn’t	 interested	 in	 technical	 investing.	 I
wasn’t	interested	in	fundamental	investing.	Although	fundamental	analysis	made
sense	to	me,	it	didn’t	connect	with	me.	I	thought	it	was	boring.	There	were	a	lot
of	smart	people	doing	fundamental	analysis,	and	I	knew	I	would	never	be	willing
to	spend	enough	time	at	it	to	be	better	than	everyone	else.

**How	would	you	summarize	the	main	lesson	you	got	from	Lynch’s	book?**

For	me,	the	central	theme	was	the	concept	of	looking	for	investments	in	your
everyday	life.

**When	did	you	open	your	account?**

When	I	was	in	college,	I	opened	an	account	at	Fidelity.	When	the	college	got	a
Bloomberg	terminal,	no	one	knew	how	to	use	it.	I	read	the	manual	and	learned
how	to	use	the	terminal.	I	did	a	lot	of	options	trading	in	college	because	I	didn’t
have	much	money,	and	I	figured	the	only	way	I	could	generate	any	real	return	on
my	 limited	 resources	 was	 by	 using	 options.	 I	 was	 trading	 out-of-the-money,
high-risk	options	almost	every	time.	I	was	going	for	the	big	20X	profits	and
losing	money	on	virtually	every	trade.

**How	did	you	get	the	money	to	trade?**

I	 still	 had	 my	 car	 detailing	 business	 on	 the	 weekends,	 and	 I	 was	 earning
considerable	money	from	it.	I	also	got	a	full-time	position	at	Fidelity	as	a	mutual
fund	trader,	which	was	a	lot	less	exciting	than	it	sounded.	My	job	was	answering
phones	and	providing	mutual	fund	quotes	to	customers.

**You	had	a	full-time	job	plus	detailing	cars!	How	did	you	have	any	time	to
study?**


I	have	found	that	the	busier	I	am,	the	better	I	do	on	everything.	I	also	didn’t	have
an	interest	in	college;	I	just	did	what	I	needed	to	do	to	get	through.	I	would
regularly	skip	classes	to	go	to	the	basement	to	use	the	one	payphone	to	touch-
tone	trades.	I	would	have	to	touch-tone	in	the	option	code,	and	then	the	computer
program	would	read	back	the	option	symbol	I	had	typed	in.	It	was	a	very	slow
process.	Sometimes	it	would	take	me	15	to	20	minutes	to	get	one	trade	through.

**I	thought	you	were	working	at	Fidelity	full-time.	How	could	you	be	placing
these	orders?**

My	job	at	Fidelity	was	after	market	hours.

**How	big	was	your	trading	account?**

It	was	very	small	because	I	kept	losing	money	on	almost	every	trade	[he	laughs].

**Did	you	have	any	winning	trades?**

I	had	some,	but	I	don’t	remember	what	they	were.	All	I	know	is	that	I	lost	every
dollar	that	I	invested.

**So	you	were	making	money	working	and	then	losing	it	investing.**

I	was	losing	100%	of	it.

**Ironically,	your	first	trade	did	so	extraordinarily	well,	and	then	you	lost
consistently.**

My	first	trade	got	me	hooked,	and	then	I	spent	years	losing	money	in	a	variety	of
ways.	I	realized	that	I	didn’t	have	any	superior	method	for	trading	using	known
techniques.	At	some	point	during	all	of	this,	I	lost	interest	in	investing.

**I	am	not	surprised,	given	the	results.	Obviously,	at	some	point,	you	regained
your	interest	in	markets.	When	did	you	get	back	into	trading,	and	what	was
the	catalyst?**

It	was	quite	a	while	later—maybe	10	years—before	I	started	trading	again.	At
the	 time,	 I	 was	 working	 for	 a	 market	 research	 firm	 and	 doing	 well,	 but	 my
financial	needs	were	more	extensive	than	the	income	my	job	could	deliver.	So,	at
some	point,	I	got	back	into	trading.	I	didn’t	have	a	lot	of	money	at	the	time—I
think	I	started	with	around	$80,000	in	my	account.

**Given	how	unsuccessful	you	had	been	in	your	previous	trading	attempts,
what	made	you	think	this	was	a	way	to	make	money?**

I	knew	there	was	opportunity	there,	but	I	just	had	not	figured	it	out	yet.	I	don’t
know	 what	 made	 me	 go	 back	 to	 my	 original	 methodology.	 It	 was	 probably
subconscious,	but	I	just	naturally	went	there.	Also,	it	probably	helped	that	I	was
in	the	market	research	industry.	I	was	running	the	entire	panel	department	for	the


largest	panel	company	in	the	world.	[A	market	research	panel	company	selects	a
panel	from	its	large	population	of	participating	respondents	to	match	the	target
audience	needed	for	a	survey.]

I	had	visibility	into	a	tremendous	amount	of	research.	I	realized	market	research
was	not	as	accurate	as	you	would	like	it	to	be.	People	don’t	do	what	they	say
they	are	going	to	do.	For	example,	when	the	iPhone	was	coming	out,	you	might
ask	people	the	question,	“Would	you	buy	a	phone	without	a	keyboard?”	And
people	would	say,	“No,	I	would	never	buy	a	phone	without	a	keyboard.”	I	saw	so
much	of	this	disconnect	between	what	people	said	and	what	they	did	that	I	lost
complete	faith	in	market	research	as	an	industry.	It	was	also	really	slow.

**It	sounds	like	it’s	more	an	issue	of	accuracy	rather	than	slowness.**

It	was	slow	as	well.	When	a	firm	looks	to	generate	research,	they	would	have	to
come	up	with	the	thesis	of	the	study,	hire	a	third-party	company	to	formulate	the
questions,	which	would	take	weeks,	and	then	the	questions	would	go	to	a	panel
company.	 By	 the	 time	 you’re	 done,	 you	 are	 six	 or	 seven	 weeks	 in	 trying	 to
analyze	results.	I	knew	it	was	inefficient.	When	I	started	trading	again,	I	went
back	to	my	original	methodology	of	investing	based	on	what	I	observed.	At	the
time,	I	didn’t	know	if	I	was	just	being	lucky	or	was	really	onto	something.	But,
in	the	course	of	a	few	years,	almost	every	trade	I	made	was	profitable.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	some	of	those	trades?**

It	was	Peter	Lynch	type	stuff.	Some	examples	would	be	the	Cheesecake	Factory
or	P.F.	Chang’s.	If	you	are	a	trader	on	Wall	Street,	you	don’t	see	Cheesecake
Factory	 or	 P.F.	 Chang’s	 first	 hand.	 You	 can	 read	 about	 it,	 but	 you	 don’t
understand	what	those	restaurant	chains	were	to	Middle	America.	One	of	the
enormous	 advantages	 I	 had	 was	 that	 by	 living	 in	 Texas,	 I	 was	 able	 to	 see
firsthand	what	phenomenal	investments	they	were.	They	were	game-changers.
For	the	first	time,	you	had	multi-hour	waits	in	the	middle	of	the	week	to	get	into
a	restaurant	chain.	These	were	people	who	had	never	had	Chinese	food.

**And	 they	 still	 hadn’t.	 Was	 it	 a	 matter	 of	 seeing	 the	 long	 lines	 at	 these
restaurants?**

It	wasn’t	so	much	that	as	it	was	realizing	that	Wall	Street	had	blinders	on	to
certain	things	because	of	a	geographic	bias,	or	other	bias.	People	sometimes	say,
“I	 bet	 your	 methodology	 works	 well	 on	 small	 companies,	 but	 it	 could	 never
work	 on	 large	 companies.”	 That’s	 untrue.	 I	 traded	 Apple	 when	 the	 original
iPhone	came	out	because	of	a	bias	that	very	few	people	realized	existed.

The	original	iPhone	was	initially	released	only	on	AT&T.	At	the	time,	the	AT&T


network	in	Manhattan	was	notoriously	terrible.	It	was	virtually	unusable.	No	one
talked	about	that	fact,	but	it	was	a	primary	reason	why	the	iPhone	had	slower
adoption	in	the	first	year	after	its	release	within	the	financial	community	than	in
the	rest	of	the	world.	On	top	of	that,	the	financial	industry	was	tied	hook,	line,
and	 sinker	 to	 the	 BlackBerry	 because	 they	 needed	 it	 for	 corporate
communications.	I	saw	those	biases	early	on.	I	had	friends	in	New	York,	and	the
first	thing	they	said	about	the	iPhone	was,	“We	can’t	use	the	iPhone	here	because
it’s	on	AT&T.”

I’ll	never	forget	the	first	day	the	iPhone	came	out.	I	know	exactly	where	I	was
when	the	first	person	showed	it	to	me.	I	was	at	a	party,	and	I	saw	the	reaction	of
25	people.	I	knew	right	then	and	there	that	it	was	going	to	be	big,	and	I	wasn’t	an
Apple	person.	I	had	never	even	owned	an	Apple	product	in	my	life.

I	shocked	myself	by	how	well	I	did	in	that	first	year	after	I	went	back	to	trading,
and,	quite	honestly,	I	didn’t	know	if	it	was	just	a	matter	of	my	being	lucky.	At
the	time,	I	signed	up	for	Covestor,	which	was	a	portfolio	tracking	service.	For	a
while,	I	was	the	top	trader	out	of	about	30,000	accounts	on	Covestor.	That	was
when	I	knew	I	was	really	onto	something.	I’ll	never	forget	telling	my	friend	at
work,	“At	some	point,	I’m	going	to	be	making	more	money	on	my	brokerage
account	than	I	am	from	this	job.”	At	my	peak	salary,	I	was	making	just	over
$200,000	 a	 year.	 At	 the	 time,	 my	 account	 was	 only	 about	 $100,000,	 but	 the
growth	was	pretty	rapid.	I	remember	wondering	whether	I	would	be	able	to	build
the	account	to	$1	million.	It	didn’t	take	that	long	until	the	account	reached	$1
million,	and	I	was	making	more	from	my	trading	than	from	my	job.	That	was	the
day	I	quit	my	job.

**Did	you	leave	so	that	you	could	trade	full-time?**

Yes,	and	that	was	dangerous	for	me.	It	is	something	I	have	struggled	with	ever
since.	 Looking	 back,	 I	 think	 a	 big	 part	 of	 my	 success	 when	 I	 went	 back	 to
trading	 was	 my	 ability	 to	 look	 past	 the	 noise	 and	 be	 patient.	 I	 wasn’t	 in	 the
industry.	It	wasn’t	my	job,	and	I	wasn’t	under	any	pressure	to	trade.	I	could	go
six	months	without	a	trade,	and	I	didn’t	have	to	answer	to	anybody.	My	biggest
mistakes	over	the	years	have	always	been	a	consequence	of	trading	too	much.	If
I	 just	 stuck	 to	 my	 highest	 conviction	 trades,	 I	 believe	 my	 account	 would	 be
tenfold	 what	 it	 is	 today.	 My	 methodology	 works	 best	 when	 I	 identify	 a
significant	piece	of	off-radar	information	that	allows	me	to	have	a	tremendous
amount	of	conviction	going	into	a	trade.	And	that	doesn’t	happen	very	often.	It’s
very	difficult	to	say,	“I’m	going	to	wait	for	a	high-conviction	trade	and	not	do


anything	for	the	next	three	months.”

**Can	 you	 elaborate	 on	 your	 methodology	 for	 identifying	 those	 high-
conviction	trades?**

I	call	what	I	do	“social	arbitrage.”	What	the	word	“social”	means	to	me	is	that	it
is	something	not	financial.	My	trading	is	dependent	on	my	ability	to	identify
meaningful	 off-radar	 information	 early—information	 that	 is	 either	 not
recognized	or	is	underappreciated	by	the	investment	public.	In	some	ways,	my
focus	 was	 the	 inverse	 of	 what	 it	 was	 during	 my	 garage	 sale	 years.	 In	 my
purchases	 at	 garage	 sales,	 I	 was	 focused	 on	 male-oriented	 items	 that	 female
garage	sale	organizers	had	mispriced.	I	quickly	realized	that	a	lot	of	the	biases	on
Wall	Street	provided	opportunities	for	me	to	identify	information	that	was	either
female-oriented,	or	youth-oriented,	or	rural-oriented.	I	don’t	want	to	say	that	my
methodology	 is	 totally	 dependent	 on	 those	 areas,	 but	 in	 my	 earlier	 years,	 it
focused	on	those	areas.	I	immersed	myself	in	fashion	and	pop	culture—things
that	are	entirely	off	the	radar	screen	of	the	typical	Wall	Street	trader	or	fund
manager.

**How	did	you	spot	trading	opportunities?**

I	would	term	it	as	retraining	your	brain.	You	are	still	living	your	normal	life,	but
you	are	observing	in	a	very	different	way.	Anytime	I	uncovered	anything	that
was	potentially	meaningful,	I	would	follow	up	with	more	research.	For	example,
when	Wendy’s	announced	their	pretzel	bacon	cheeseburger	back	in	2013,	I	went
out	to	observe	as	much	as	I	could.	I	spoke	to	the	managers	at	a	dozen	different
Wendy’s	locations.	I	asked	them	how	many	years	they	had	been	at	Wendy’s	and
how	 this	 item	 compared	 with	 other	 past	 seasonal	 items.	 And	 every	 time	 the
answer	I	got	was	the	same:	“We’ve	never	seen	anything	like	this	before.”	I	spoke
to	the	customers	about	what	they	thought.

**But	you	are	only	surveying	consumer	sentiment	in	Dallas.	How	do	you	know
it’s	at	all	representative	of	what’s	happening	in	the	country	as	a	whole?**

What	 is	 amazing	 about	 Dallas	 is	 that	 it	 may	 just	 be	 one	 of	 the	 most
representative	markets	in	the	country.	I	also	looked	at	different	online	chat	sites
where	people	talk	about	fast	food.	I	know	that	sounds	crazy,	but	these	sites	exist.
It	was	a	great	trade	that	was	totally	missed	by	Wall	Street.	Every	fast-food	chain
has	a	seasonal	item	they	introduce,	usually	in	the	spring.	Typically,	these	items
come	in	and	go	away,	and	it’s	no	big	deal.	This	item,	however,	was	so	large	that
it	moved	the	needle	for	the	entire	company.	Because	that	type	of	impact	had	not
happened	before,	it	wasn’t	on	the	radar	of	people	who	follow	the	stock.


**Out	of	the	many	trades	you’ve	made	in	your	career,	do	any	stand	out	as
particularly	painful?**

Ironically,	one	of	my	most	regretful	trades	was	also	one	of	my	largest	winners.
Many	years	ago,	it	was	a	brutal	winter,	and	I	had	identified	massive	consumer
adoption	of	Under	Armour’s	ColdGear	that	was	being	completely	ignored	by	the
street.	 Their	 ColdGear	 was	 underwear	 designed	 to	 keep	 you	 warm	 in	 cold
weather.

**I	cross	country	ski,	and	I	remember	buying	long	underwear	by	brands	such
as	Patagonia	as	far	back	as	the	1970s.	What	was	different	about	ColdGear?**

Under	Armour	made	it	for	the	masses.	They	had	a	wider	distribution	of	this	type
of	product	than	anyone	ever	had.

**How	did	you	spot	the	consumer	trend?**

I	spotted	that	trend	off	of	social	media.	I	have	a	large	number	of	proprietary
word	groups	that	I	monitor	every	evening.	At	the	time,	I	was	monitoring	a	word
combination	that	included	ColdGear,	Under	Armour,	and	some	other	words.	I
measure	the	conversational	volume	of	the	word	groups	I	follow,	and	if	I	see	the
volume	is	abnormally	high,	that	is	the	first	signal	for	me	that	something	is	up.	I
spend	only	about	four	hours	a	day	on	trade	research	and	analysis,	but	when	I	find
something	like	the	Under	Armour	trade,	I	will	spend	14	or	15	hours	a	day	for
days	or	even	weeks	on	due	diligence.

**What	specifically	do	you	mean	by	due	diligence?**

I	will	try	to	accumulate	every	bit	of	data	I	can	that	is	related	to	my	trade.	I	start
with	a	hypothesis.	In	this	particular	case,	my	hypothesis	was	that	Under	Armour
was	experiencing	exceptional	sales	of	their	ColdGear	products.	Then	I	have	to
test	my	hypothesis.	I	interviewed	store	managers	and	consumers.	I	went	online
and	 scoured	 every	 piece	 of	 information	 related	 to	 my	 assumption.	 I	 had	 full
corroboration	by	virtually	every	piece	of	information	I	checked.	It	was	one	of	the
largest	trades	I	ever	made.	When	I	have	a	high-conviction	trade,	I	can	get	to	the
point	where	I	have	95%	plus	confidence	in	the	trade.	But	even	with	that	high
level	of	confidence,	it	doesn’t	necessarily	mean	I	will	make	money	on	the	trade.
There	are	always	external	factors	at	play.

**Why	was	this	one	of	your	most	regretful	trades?**

Because	several	days	before	Under	Armour	reported	earnings,	Lululemon	came
out	with	their	earnings,	and	it	was	a	disaster.

**Were	Under	Armour	and	Lululemon	correlated?**


At	the	time,	they	were	correlated	enough	so	that	after	Lululemon	saw	one	of	its
most	 substantial	 breaks	 following	 its	 earnings,	 Under	 Armour	 got	 crushed	 as
well.

**I	guess	that	is	a	perfect	example	of	what	you	would	call	an	external	factor.**

Yes.	Then	a	relatively	respected	research	firm	came	out	with	a	bearish	report	on
Under	 Armour,	 anticipating	 a	 negative	 earnings	 report.	 Meanwhile,	 I	 was
holding	one	of	my	largest	positions	ever.	A	week	before,	I	had	98%	conviction;
after	these	events,	my	conviction	level	had	fallen	to	maybe	60%.

**So,	what	did	you	do?**

I	sold	off	about	two-thirds	of	my	position	just	out	of	fear	and	self-doubt.

**How	large	was	your	position?**

I	was	risking	about	8%–10%	of	my	equity.	But	my	position	was	expressed	in
options,	so	if	the	stock	closed	below	the	option	strike	prices,	I	could	lose	the
entire	amount.	It	was	a	big	trade	for	me.	I	didn’t	want	to	lose	that	in	one	day.

**Do	you	typically	use	options	to	express	your	positions?**

I	 will	 use	 options	 when	 there	 is	 adequate	 liquidity,	 and	 the	 option	 price	 is
reasonable.

**In	what	percent	of	trades	are	those	conditions	fulfilled?**

Roughly	50%.

**I	guess	you	use	options	to	leverage	your	trades?**

Yes.

**Do	you	use	out-of-the-money,	at-the-money,	or	in-the-money	options?**

It	 has	 changed	 over	 my	 trading	 career.	 I	 used	 to	 use	 more	 out-of-the-money
options.	Now	that	my	portfolio	has	grown	over	the	years,	I	tend	to	use	at-the-
money	or	in-the-money	options.	But	if	it	is	a	very	high-conviction	trade,	I	will
occasionally	invest	in	out-of-the-money	options	as	well.

**What	percent	of	your	account	equity	might	you	commit	to	a	single	trade?**

On	a	high-conviction	trade,	I	could	put	in	as	much	as	5%	to	15%,	knowing	that	I
could	lose	the	entire	amount,	even	if	the	stock	doesn’t	decline	by	much.

**How	far	out	do	you	go	in	your	option	positions?**

I	attempt	to	determine	what	the	information	dissemination	event	will	be.	Usually,
it	 is	 an	 earnings	 report.	 These	 days,	 as	 Wall	 Street	 is	 getting	 smarter	 about
identifying	off-radar	information	sooner	through	credit	card	or	other	data,	a	lot
of	 the	 information	 that	 I	 trade	 on	 will	 become	 known	 before	 earnings.	 So,


sometimes,	I	will	buy	options	that	expire	before	the	earnings	date	to	save	money
on	the	option	premium.	In	those	cases,	I	actually	hope	that	the	market	will	see
what	I	see	before	earnings.

**What	happened	to	the	remainder	of	your	Under	Armour	position?**

The	Under	Armour	earnings	came	out,	and	they	were	right	in	line	with	what	I
initially	expected.	The	ColdGear	sales	were	phenomenal,	and	I	don’t	remember
exactly	how	much	the	stock	went	up,	but	it	was	probably	close	to	20%.	I	ended
up	making	a	ton	of	money	on	the	trade,	even	after	the	losses	I	took	on	the	two-
thirds	of	the	position	I	had	liquidated	previously.	If	only	I	had	kept	that	position.

**But	you	ended	up	making	a	lot	of	money.	Why	is	that	trade	so	painful?**

Because	 I	 let	 myself	 be	 swayed	 out	 of	 most	 of	 my	 position	 when	 I	 was
absolutely	right.	I	regret	that	trade	so	much.

**How	did	that	change	you?**

It	showed	me	that	this	game	is	all	about	confidence.	I	should	not	let	extraneous
factors	impact	my	confidence.	I	know	what	I	should	be	doing,	but	doing	it	is	a
different	thing.	I	used	to	have	this	thought	about	the	market	that,	“They	must
know	something	that	I	don’t	know.”	That	is	a	thought	I	have	continually	tried	to
shake	 off.	 After	 the	 Under	 Armour	 trade,	 I	 walked	 away	 saying	 to	 myself,
“Don’t	ever,	ever	get	shaken	out	of	a	trade	by	thinking	they	know	something	that
you	don’t.”

**Were	there	subsequent	trades	where	that	lesson	came	to	bear?**

Absolutely.	 A	 great	 example	 was	 Netflix	 a	 couple	 of	 years	 ago	 when	 they
released	the	show	 _Stranger	Things_ .	Netflix	is	one	of	the	most	covered	companies
in	the	world,	closely	followed	by	the	brightest	minds	on	Wall	Street.	Every	time
there	is	a	new	show	on	Netflix,	I	monitor	the	depth	of	interest	in	the	show	by
measuring	the	conversational	volume.	The	way	Wall	Street	approaches	the	stock
is	to	focus	on	viewership.	There	is	a	firm	that	provides	Nielsen-type	ratings	for
Netflix.	 The	 problem	 with	 that	 approach	 is	 that	 every	 top	 Netflix	 show	 has
roughly	the	same	amount	of	people	watching	it.	So	that	statistic	doesn’t	tell	you
anything.

When	Netflix	released	 _Stranger	Things_ ,	everyone	knew	it	was	a	hit	show—that
by	itself	wasn’t	any	real	information.	Also,	a	hit	show	on	Netflix	doesn’t	mean
anything	because	they	have	hit	shows	with	some	regularity.	The	real	question
was	whether	 _Stranger	Things_ 	was	an	anomaly.	I	measured	the	volume	of	people
speaking	the	words	 _Stranger	Things_ ,	and	then	I	compared	it	with	the	top	five
shows	they	had	produced	in	the	prior	five	years.	I	discovered	that	for	all	those


other	hit	shows,	conversational	volume	peaked	in	the	first	week	and	then	went
back	down	to	the	prior	level.	 _Stranger	Things_ 	did	something	different:	It	hit	that
peak	in	the	first	week	but	then	plateaued	at	that	level	week	after	week.	When
you	combined	all	the	mentions	during	the	first	60	days	after	the	show’s	release,
the	total	was	triple	the	second-highest	amount	for	a	past	hit	show.

What	was	particularly	interesting	about	this	trade	was	that	almost	every	single
analyst	on	the	street	was	predicting	a	bad	earnings	quarter	for	Netflix.	Here	I
was	a	few	years	after	the	Under	Armour	trade,	and	all	these	negative	reports
about	Netflix	were	coming	out	left	and	right.	It	may	still	have	made	me	nervous,
but	I	didn’t	let	it	impact	my	actions.	I	had	invested	a	large	amount	of	money	in
Netflix,	and	I	kept	the	full	position.	I	even	wrote	an	article	on	Netflix	because	I
wanted	it	time-stamped	that	I	called	this	trade	with	high	conviction.

The	earnings	came	out,	and	Netflix	not	only	knocked	it	out	of	the	park,	but	they
attributed	 the	 strong	 earnings	 to	 the	 impact	 of	 _Stranger	 Things_ .	 Although
everyone	knew	that	 _Stranger	Things_ 	was	a	hit	show,	they	didn’t	realize	it	was
different	from	all	the	other	hit	shows	in	the	past.	But	I	knew	it	was	different.	It
was	one	of	my	most	profitable	trades	for	the	year.

**Do	any	other	trades	stand	out	as	providing	a	particularly	important	lesson?**

Not	long	after	the	2008	election,	Michelle	Obama	wore	a	yellow	J.Crew	dress	on
Jay	Leno’s	 _Tonight	Show_ .	I	watched	that	episode.	This	event	was	one	of	the	most
defining	moments	for	J.Crew	in	a	decade.	After	that	show,	Michelle	Obama	was
on	the	cover	of	almost	every	tabloid	and	fashion	magazine.	Immediately	after
that,	 the	 African	 American	 demographic	 completely	 embraced	 J.Crew	 as	 a
brand.	I	totally	missed	that	trade.

**But	you	saw	it	at	the	time.	You	recognized	the	trade.**

I	didn’t	recognize	it.	I	saw	it,	but	I	didn’t	observe	it.	Missing	the	trade	was	so
impactful	for	me	that	I	went	on	eBay	and	bought	the	dress.	I	have	the	dress	in
my	closet;	I	could	show	it	to	you.

**Why	did	you	buy	the	dress?	Was	it	to	stare	you	in	the	face	as	a	reminder	of
that	missed	trade?**

Yes.	I	wanted	it	to	remind	me	of	how	much	opportunity	is	out	there	that	I	am
missing	every	day.	Missing	that	trade	made	me	realize	that	for	every	trade	that	I
found	using	this	methodology,	I	was	missing	dozens.

**How	did	that	change	you?**

I	knew	I	had	to	figure	out	a	better	way	to	apply	my	methodology.	I	needed	to


capture	more	data.	I	had	to	figure	out	how	to	broaden	the	funnel.	I	was	doing
really	 well	 with	 this	 methodology,	 and	 I	 thought,	 “If	 I	 am	 missing	 10X	 and
maybe	even	100X	more	trades,	how	big	could	this	get?”

**Why	do	you	think	you	missed	that	trade?**

My	methodology	is	so	easy	that,	theoretically,	anybody	could	do	it.	At	the	same
time,	it	is	so	hard.	When	you	see	a	big	movement	in	a	stock	price,	there	is	a
reason	why	that	price	change	happened.	In	many	cases,	the	price	moved	because
there	is	some	inflection	point	in	demand	for	that	company’s	services	or	products.
Was	 there	 a	 way	 to	 identify	 that	 change	 early?	 I	 knew	 those	 opportunities
existed,	but	I	couldn’t	figure	out	how	to	capture	more	of	them.	The	opportunities
I	was	catching	were	very	random	and	based	on	my	physicality—where	I	was,
and	what	I	saw	at	that	moment	in	time.

One	 of	 my	 best	 friends	 had	 twins,	 and	 his	 wife	 had	 a	 post	 on	 Facebook.
Paraphrasing,	the	post	said,	“My	twins	were	silent	for	the	first	time	in	their	lives.
I	thought	something	tragic	had	happened	in	my	house.	I	ran	up	to	the	playroom
and	found	them	staring	at	the	TV,	watching	the	show	 _Chuggington_ .	This	show	is
my	 savior.”	 Then	 other	 mothers	 started	 posting	 about	 how	 their	 kids	 were
obsessed	with	the	show.	Let’s	say	you	are	a	portfolio	manager,	and	you	see	this
post	 from	 your	 friend’s	 wife,	 are	 you	 going	 to	 do	 anything?	 It	 is	 probably
something	you	read	for	a	few	seconds	and	then	move	on	to	the	next	thing.	I	was
proud	of	myself	for	stopping	and	thinking,	“What	is	 _Chuggington_ ?”	I	googled
_Chuggington_ 	and	found	that	it	was	a	program	produced	by	a	small	company	in
Europe	that	fortunately	happened	to	be	publicly	traded.	I	realized	they	would
probably	get	some	big	license	deals	because	of	the	show’s	popularity	in	the	US.	I
invested	in	the	company,	and	about	four	months	later,	that	stock	was	up	50%.

That	day	I	was	on	my	game.	But	even	on	that	day,	I	don’t	know	how	many	other
similar	 opportunities	 were	 there	 that	 I	 missed.	 So	 I	 spent	 the	 next	 few	 years
obsessively	thinking	about	how	I	could	scale	the	methodology.	I	felt	that	if	I
could	pull	it	off,	I	could	either	trade	it	as	a	hedge	fund,	or	sell	it	to	Wall	Street,	or
both.	I	ultimately	ended	up	doing	both.

**How	 did	 you	 solve	 the	 problem	 of	 missing	 the	 majority	 of	 trade
opportunities	that	were	theoretically	identifiable	using	your	methodology?**

Going	on	Twitter	and	Facebook	to	manually	look	for	things	that	I	thought	were
happening	was	very	inefficient.	I	thought,	“What	if	instead,	I	could	structure	all
the	theoretical	words	and	word	combinations	that	would	represent	anything	that
would	 be	 meaningful	 to	 any	 publicly	 traded	 company?”	 Those	 terms	 would


include	 the	 name	 of	 every	 significant	 publicly	 traded	 company,	 every	 CEO,
every	 product,	 every	 brand,	 every	 technology,	 every	 cultural	 movement,	 and
every	government	regulation	that	could	affect	a	company.	Essentially,	I	needed
to	figure	out	the	name	of	anything	that	could	impact	a	company	in	any	way	that
someone	might	speak	or	write	about.	I	called	these	word	combinations	“ticker
tags.”

**It	 seems	 like	 an	 overwhelming	 amount	 of	 work	 to	 compile	 all	 these
potentially	meaningful	word	combinations.	How	could	you	possibly	do	all
that	work?**

I	had	a	partner	who	was	a	brilliant	computer	scientist,	and	we	began	by	hiring	40
students	from	local	colleges	to	curate	these	ticker	tags.	They	curated	a	quarter	of
a	million	tags.	The	idea	was	to	combine	these	ticker	tags	with	unstructured	data
licensed	from	social	media	firms,	such	as	Twitter	and	Facebook,	so	we	could
measure	 the	 relative	 frequency	 with	 which	 those	 tags	 were	 being	 mentioned
across	 these	 social	 networks	 in	 real	 time.	 For	 example,	 I	 could	 tell	 you	 how
many	people	were	talking	about	getting	an	iPhone	during	the	three	weeks	before
a	 current	 iPhone	 release	 versus	 corresponding	 periods	 for	 previous	 iPhone
releases.

**How	did	you	pay	for	this	venture?**

I	put	up	$1	million	of	my	trading	profits	to	launch	the	company,	TickerTags,	and
we	also	raised	a	few	million	dollars.

**Wouldn’t	the	value	of	these	tags	be	dependent	on	the	skill	of	the	people	who
were	putting	them	together?	How	did	you	know	these	40	students	were
doing	the	task	correctly?**

I	coached	them	on	how	to	curate	tags	for	a	company.	Each	student	had	a	list	of
companies.	For	each	company	on	their	list,	they	were	instructed	to	research	the
company,	 research	 quarterly	 earnings	 reports,	 find	 news	 articles	 about	 the
company,	all	with	an	end	goal	of	identifying	the	price	drivers	for	that	company.
They	would	tag	any	word	associated	with	anything	that	could	move	the	needle
for	the	company.	For	example,	“pretzel	bacon	cheeseburger”	would	be	a	tag	for
Wendy’s.

We	eventually	got	to	over	one	million	tags	mapped	to	over	2,000	companies.	We
could	detect	conversational	anomalies	and	understand	whether	there	was	more	or
less	 interest	 in	 a	 granular	 topic	 than	 a	 particular	 benchmark,	 whether	 that
benchmark	was	internal	to	the	company—a	comparison	to	a	previous	year—or
whether	 the	 benchmark	 was	 a	 competing	 product.	 Anytime	 conversational


volume	would	pick	up	around	a	granular	subject,	our	system	would	identify	it.	I
believed	that	this	was	the	end	game	for	me—the	culmination	of	everything	I	had
worked	for	in	my	methodology.	I	thought	we	had	built	what	could	be	the	most
impactful	institutional	data	product	for	Wall	Street.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	how	TickerTags	helped	you	identify	a	trade
that	you	would	otherwise	have	missed	before?**

Through	 TickerTags,	 we	 can	 now	 discover	 products	 very	 early	 on.	 A	 perfect
product	example	is	La	Croix.	Are	you	familiar	with	La	Croix?

**My	wife	and	I	practically	buy	it	by	the	truckload.**

Very	early	on,	we	were	able	to	spot	the	conversational	acceleration	in	people
talking	about	La	Croix,	and	not	just	La	Croix,	but	bottled	water	in	general	as	a
market	segment.	Years	before	Wall	Street	realized	this	was	a	thing,	we	were	able
to	 identify	 the	 change	 in	 consumer	 behavior.	 I	 was	 a	 very	 early	 investor	 in
National	 Beverage	 Corporation,	 which	 is	 this	 weird	 company	 in	 Florida	 that
manufacturers	La	Croix,	and	La	Croix	accounts	for	the	majority	of	their	revenue.
So	National	Beverage	Corporation	was	almost	a	pure	play	on	La	Croix.

Everything	I	do	is	about	early	detection	of	change.	That’s	it.	I	always	knew	that
if	we	could	develop	something	to	detect	change	early,	that	was	all	you	needed	on
Wall	Street.	What	is	the	earliest	point	you	can	identify	change?	It’s	always	going
to	be	when	people	are	talking	about	something.	We	were	able	to	recognize	the
social	shift	away	from	soda	and	toward	sparkling	water	early,	and	La	Croix	just
happened	to	be	the	brand	sitting	there	when	that	cultural	shift	occurred.	I	live	for
that.	National	Beverage	was	the	most	beautiful	pure	trade	on	this	methodology—
early	detection	of	a	cultural	change	that	was	going	to	have	a	positive	impact	on	a
specific	company	and	a	negative	effect	on	other	companies.

The	 information	 timeline	 begins	 with	 social	 communication—people	 talking
with	 each	 other	 online	 or	 offline.	 Then	 it	 makes	 its	 way	 to	 the	 non-financial
press.	After	that,	the	financial	media	picks	it	up.	As	the	last	step,	it	hits	company
earnings	statements.

Wall	Street	now	has	access	to	data	they	never	had	before,	such	as	credit	card
transactions.	Credit	card	data	shows	what	people	are	buying	before	the	earnings
come	out.	That’s	my	competition	as	a	trader.	I	can’t	rely	on	credit	card	data,
which,	by	the	way,	I	subscribe	to.

**Which	is	earlier,	the	social	chatter	or	the	credit	card	data?**

That	is	precisely	the	point.	How	can	you	go	even	earlier	than	transactional	data?
The	only	way	to	get	earlier	information	is	to	pay	attention	to	conversation	trends.


I	 often	 have	 people	 say,	 “So,	 you’re	 trying	 to	 predict	 the	 future	 in	 people’s
behavior.”	That’s	incorrect.	I’m	not	trying	to	predict	the	future;	I	am	trying	to
accurately	and	quickly	depict	the	present.	I’m	not	trying	to	predict	what	people
will	 do,	 but	 rather	 identify	 what	 they	 are	 doing	 right	 now.	 What	 are	 they
interested	 in	 right	 now?	 What	 are	 they	 buying	 right	 now?	 People	 talk	 about
something	when	it	is	happening	or	immediately	before	it	happens.	In	my	world,
that	is	the	earliest	point	at	which	you	can	detect	change.

**Why	then	do	you	subscribe	to	transactional	data	when	you	already	have	the
earlier	signal	provided	by	social	information?**

I	 subscribe	 to	 transactional	 data	 because	 I	 want	 to	 understand	 when	 the
information	I	have	is	being	disseminated.

**Oh,	so	you	use	the	transactional	data	as	your	exit.**

Yes,	 when	 I	 believe	 it	 indicates	 the	 information	 has	 already	 been	 sufficiently
disseminated.

**Do	you	have	any	examples	of	where	an	increase	in	online	chatter	led	to	a
shorting	opportunity?**

Sure.	I	love	cultural	shifts	because	Wall	Street	is	always	late	catching	on.	There
was	a	cultural	shift	of	women	going	from	traditional	bras	to	wireless	bras	or
wearing	no	bra	at	all.	Very	early	on,	I	was	able	to	detect	that	women	were	talking
more	and	more	about	going	“braless”	or	wearing	“bralettes,”	which	is	how	they
referred	to	wireless	bras.	If	you	look	at	Victoria’s	Secret,	they	are	famous	for	the
traditional	wired,	push-up	bra,	which	is	their	brand	image.	I	knew	this	trend	was
going	to	be	destructive	to	their	brand.	It	was	so	obvious	if	you	were	monitoring
the	conversational	frequency	of	the	terms	“braless”	and	“bralette.”	Wall	Street
didn’t	see	it	at	all.

**I	assume	you	bought	puts	to	take	advantage	of	the	trade	idea.**

Yes,	I	bought	short-term	puts	before	each	of	two	consecutive	earnings	reports,
and	both	trades	worked	out	very	well.

**Any	other	shorting	examples?**

Yes,	here	is	one	of	my	all-time	favorite	trades.	I’m	sure	you	remember	when	the
E.	coli	scare	hit	Chipotle.

**I	sure	do.**

There	was	a	tremendous	amount	of	work	done	on	Wall	Street	to	determine	the
impact	of	the	E.	coli	scare	on	foot	traffic	at	Chipotle.	Before	this	E.	coli	scare,
Chipotle	had	become	famous	for	having	long	lines	at	lunchtime.	Chipotle	was


such	a	trendy	brand	that	it	was	common	for	people	to	tweet	about	having	lunch
there.	They	would	also	frequently	tweet	about	how	they	were	waiting	in	line	at
Chipotle.	 I	 was	 able	 to	 gauge	 real-time	 foot	 traffic	 by	 monitoring	 word
combinations,	such	as	“Chipotle”	plus	“lunch,”	and	“Chipotle”	plus	“line,”	in
online	 conversations.	 Almost	 overnight,	 the	 mentions	 of	 these	 word
combinations	dropped	by	about	50%.

**When	the	E.	coli	news	came	out,	it	was	on	all	the	evening	news	channels.
Didn’t	the	stock	take	an	immediate	dive?**

The	 stock	 took	 an	 immediate	 dive,	 but	 not	 remotely	 close	 to	 the	 decline	 it
ultimately	experienced.	The	general	market	perception	was	that	the	E.	coli	scare
wouldn’t	 have	 a	 long-lasting	 impact.	 No	 one	 anticipated	 the	 extraordinary
collapse	in	foot	traffic	that	would	ultimately	result	from	this	event.	But	I	could
tell	that	the	foot	traffic	was	staying	down	because,	for	the	next	year,	the	word
mentions	with	Chipotle	never	recovered.

**When	did	you	go	short?**

It	was	soon	after	the	event,	but	for	the	next	year,	I	traded	in	and	out	of	Chipotle
around	news	dissemination	events,	such	as	earnings	reports.

Oh,	another	great	shorting	example	was	SeaWorld	in	the	aftermath	of	the	release
of	the	documentary	 _Blackfish_.

**Yes,	 I	 saw	 it.	 It	 was	 excellent.	 [The	 movie	 is	 a	 documentary	 about	 the
physical	and	psychological	harm	experienced	by	killer	whales	in	captivity
told	with	a	focus	on	one	SeaWorld	orca	responsible	for	the	deaths	of	three
people,	including	a	veteran	trainer.]**

The	movie	triggered	a	massive,	global	online	hate	campaign	against	SeaWorld.
We	 see	 negative	 things	 happen	 to	 brands	 all	 the	 time,	 and	 they	 can	 usually
recover	relatively	quickly.	The	typical	scenario	is	that	something	bad	happens,
the	company	does	some	brand	repair,	and	then	weeks	or	months	later,	everybody
forgets	about	it.	SeaWorld	was	one	of	those	rare	situations	where	the	level	of
negative	 conversation	 spiked,	 and	 then	 just	 kept	 building.	 Unlike	 many	 other
negative	events	that	happen	to	companies,	this	one	didn’t	die	out.	SeaWorld’s
market	cap	dropped	by	over	40%	during	the	next	year	and	a	half.	I	shorted	the
stock	 repeatedly	 during	 that	 period,	 trading	 in	 and	 out	 around	 information
dissemination	events,	such	as	earnings	calls,	because	I	knew	the	situation	wasn’t
improving,	and	the	market	refused	to	believe	it.

**Was	this	a	matter	of	looking	for	mentions	of	SeaWorld?**

No,	 this	 was	 a	 situation	 where	 I	 was	 interpreting	 the	 sentiment	 of	 the


conversation,	which	was	extraordinarily	negative.	Nearly	100%	of	all	the	social
conversation	around	SeaWorld	after	the	movie	was	released	was	negative,	and	it
didn’t	go	neutral	for	years.	I	usually	don’t	trade	on	sentiment,	but	this	was	one	of
those	rare	circumstances	where	the	sentiment	was	extraordinarily	one-sided.

**What	percent	of	your	trades	are	on	the	short	side?**

About	20%.	I	am	neutral	and	opportunistic,	but	for	whatever	reason,	about	80%
of	the	insights	I	uncover	are	on	the	long	side.	It	could	be	that	when	you	are
looking	for	anomalies	in	conversational	volume,	more	often	than	not,	they	will
involve	something	positive	rather	than	negative.

**Why	did	you	decide	to	sell	TickerTags?**

A	few	years	ago,	we	received	a	call	from	Twitter,	informing	us	that	our	data	rates
were	going	to	increase	in	the	coming	years,	and	the	amount	of	increase	was	very
substantial.	 We	 had	 to	 decide	 whether	 to	 raise	 another	 $5	 million	 in	 venture
capital	 or	 sell	 the	 company,	 and	 we	 decided	 to	 sell	 the	 company.	 I	 built
TickerTags,	not	because	I	thought	it	was	a	good	idea	that	other	people	would
like,	but	because	it	was	something	I	knew	that	I	needed	to	have.	So,	here	we	are
today,	TickerTags	is	no	longer	my	company,	and	I	get	to	be	a	client.

**I	assume	you	get	a	free	subscription.**

I	am	still	a	consultant	to	the	company.	I’m	helping	them	to	refine	the	platform
because	I	am	knee-deep	into	it.	I	appreciate	the	platform	more	than	any	other
client.

**Do	you	get	paid	for	being	a	consultant?**

I	get	a	free	subscription	to	TickerTags,	which	is	a	very	expensive	platform.	The
subscriptions	are	only	available	to	hedge	funds	and	banks.

**Aren’t	you	concerned	that	having	this	tool	available	to	hedge	funds	and
proprietary	trading	operations	will	compromise	its	effectiveness?**

No,	because	I	think	it	will	be	a	very	long	time	before	hedge	funds	are	going	to
have	the	confidence	in	this	tool	that	I	have.	In	fact,	while	we	were	developing
TickerTags,	I	would	often	share	my	trade	ideas	with	hedge	funds.

**Did	you	share	the	ideas	after	you	put	on	the	trades?**

I	 would	 speak	 freely	 about	 my	 trades	 with	 hedge	 funds,	 even	 if	 I	 was	 only
partially	positioned.

**Weren’t	you	concerned	that	sharing	the	information	would	move	the	trade
before	you	fully	got	in?**

No,	because	I	knew	these	guys	wouldn’t	move	on	the	information.	This	type	of


methodology	is	so	foreign	to	them	that	their	lack	of	comfort	and	confidence	in
this	approach	would	lead	them	to	move	much	more	slowly	on	the	trade	than	I
would,	if	they	made	the	trade	at	all.

I	 used	 to	 ask	 myself,	 why	 isn’t	 Wall	 Street	 digging	 in	 deeper	 into	 my
methodology?	I	never	understood	it	until	I	started	TickerTags.	After	it	launched,
I	was	in	New	York	every	other	week	for	two	years	straight.	I	met	with	almost
every	top	hedge	fund.	These	managers	were	some	of	the	smartest	people	I	have
ever	met.	Their	world	is	really	noisy.	They	have	a	hundred	different	ways	to	look
at	things.	They	are	so	entrenched	in	doing	things	a	certain	way	that	for	them	to
adopt	what	I	do	would	be	radical	and	extreme.	They	can’t	look	at	something	like
conversational	 volume	 impacting	 a	 specific	 stock	 because	 there	 is	 no	 history
there.	They	want	to	see	high	correlation	to	trust	the	data.

I	can’t	say	that	every	time	conversational	volume	peaked	in	the	way	it	did	for
Netflix,	the	stock	moved.	It	was	a	one-of-a-kind	event.	You	have	to	understand
and	interpret	this	data.	You	have	to	be	willing	to	trust	it.	Hedge	fund	managers
want	something	repeatable	and	systematic.	They	wanted	to	know	how	often	this
approach	would	generate	tradable	information	with	high	conviction.	I	couldn’t
give	them	a	hard	answer.	It	could	be	a	handful	of	times	a	year;	it	could	be	25
times	a	year.	They	want	things	that	are	repeatable	and	work	for	thousands	of
tickers.	 They	 have	 a	 lack	 of	 comfort	 with	 the	 variability	 in	 how	 this	 data	 is
applied,	but	I	don’t.

**Unless	the	methodology	is	your	own,	you	won’t	trust	it.	I	don’t	know	what
percent	 of	 systems	 sold	 to	 the	 public	 have	 any	 value.	 But,	 I	 always	 tell
people	 that	 even	 if	 90%	 plus	 of	 the	 systems	 sold	 make	 money	 with
reasonable	risk—a	drastic	overstatement	I’m	sure—I	would	bet	that	over
90%	of	the	people	who	purchased	those	systems	would	still	lose	money.
Why?	Because	every	system	or	method	will	have	its	losing	periods,	and	if
you	 don’t	 have	 confidence	 in	 the	 approach,	 which	 you	 won’t	 if	 the
methodology	is	not	your	own,	you	will	abandon	it.	You’re	coming	to	hedge
funds	with	a	strategy	they	have	never	used,	so	they	can	never	have	your
conviction.	It	even	took	you	many	years	to	get	to	that	point.**

Not	just	many	years;	it	took	me	over	a	decade	to	get	to	the	point	where	I	had
high	conviction	in	my	methodology.

**When	you	get	a	volume	spike	in	one	of	your	tags,	couldn’t	it	just	as	well	be
bearish	as	bullish?**

I	look	at	the	context	of	the	conversation.	It	doesn’t	take	long	to	determine	the


narrative.	I	will	never	trade	on	data	alone.	Every	trade	I	do	has	a	thesis	with	a
narrative	associated	with	it.

I	will	use	a	trade	I	am	in	right	now	as	an	example.	About	two	months	ago,	I
noticed	a	conversational	spike	in	e.l.f.,	a	manufacturer	of	low-priced	cosmetics,
that	hadn’t	been	doing	too	well	in	the	past	few	years.	That	alone	didn’t	tell	me
anything.	Was	there	a	spike	because	people	liked	a	product	or	because	they	were
complaining	about	a	product?

Some	further	checking	revealed	the	spike	could	be	traced	to	a	video	made	by	a
makeup	 tutorial	 artist	 named	 Jeffree	 Star,	 who	 has	 15	 million	 followers	 on
YouTube.	 Jeffree	 had	 made	 a	 video	 where	 on	 half	 his	 face,	 he	 used	 an	 e.l.f.
product	that	is	sold	at	Walgreens	and	Target	and	costs	about	$8,	and	on	the	other
half	of	his	face,	he	used	a	top-selling	product	that	costs	$60.	He	said	that	the	$8
product	 was	 as	 good	 as	 the	 $60	 product.	 He	 instantaneously	 changed	 the
consumer	perception	of	the	e.l.f.	brand	from	being	viewed	as	a	cheap	drugstore
product	to	being	considered	a	quality	product.	The	stock	moved	up	more	than
50%	in	two	months.	The	odd	thing	is	that	I	bet	that	most	analysts	who	cover
e.l.f.	have	no	idea	who	Jeffree	Star	is.

**Are	there	cases	where	you	used	the	same	word	combination	for	both	bullish
and	bearish	trades?**

Sure,	Smith	&	Wesson	is	a	good	example.	The	combination	of	the	words	“gun”
plus	“class”	is	a	good	indication	of	the	degree	to	which	people	are	buying	guns.

**“Gun”	and	“class”?**

Yes,	class.	Interesting,	right?	When	people	go	out	and	purchase	a	gun	for	the
first	time,	they	start	searching	for	gun	classes.	Another	word	combination	that	is
a	good	indicator	of	gun	sales	is	“gun”	plus	“ban.”	So	anytime	I	saw	a	spike	in
the	 number	 of	 people	 concerned	 about	 guns	 being	 banned	 and	 also	 people
looking	for	gun	classes,	I	would	view	it	as	an	early	sign	that	gun	sales	were
increasing.	 I	 used	 these	 word	 combinations	 as	 a	 buy	 signal	 for	 American
Outdoors	Brand	Corporation,	the	maker	of	Smith	&	Wesson,	multiple	times.	I
also	 used	 it	 as	 a	 bearish	 signal	 when	 Trump	 came	 into	 office.	 There	 was	 a
notable	drop	in	people	talking	about	gun	bans	and	gun	classes,	and	sure	enough,
the	gun	market	fell	apart,	and	gun	stocks	got	killed.

Another	example	where	I	was	able	to	trade	both	sides	of	the	market	using	the
same	word	combination	was	Beacon	Roofing,	which	is	one	of	the	largest	roofing
distributors	in	the	country.	One	of	the	things	that	cause	Beacon	Roofing’s	sales
to	 go	 up	 is	 when	 there	 is	 a	 larger-than-normal	 hail	 season.	 Hail	 damage	 is


difficult	to	detect	because	even	if	there	are	more	hailstorms,	if	the	storms	are	not
located	in	highly	populated	areas	with	lots	of	roofs,	they	will	not	make	a	big	dent
in	the	roofing	business.

**No	pun	intended.**

Yes,	exactly	[he	laughs	at	his	unintended	pun].	The	insurance	industry	puts	out	a
report	 on	 estimated	 roofing	 damage	 claims,	 but	 that	 report	 is	 released	 many
months	after	the	fact.	I	will	look	at	the	word	combination	of	“roof,”	“hail,”	and
“damage.”	 Every	 March–May	 period	 there	 is	 a	 seasonal	 spike	 in	 this	 word
combination.	A	couple	of	years	ago,	I	noticed	a	seasonal	spike	that	was	triple	the
size	 of	 any	 previous	 seasonal	 spike.	 There	 were	 three	 such	 abnormally	 high
spikes	in	a	row.	I	realized	it	was	a	severe	hail	season,	and	I	took	a	long	position
in	Beacon	Roofing	based	on	that	assumption.	As	I	expected,	Beacon	Roofing
subsequently	 came	 out	 with	 a	 very	 bullish	 earnings	 report.	 Conversely,	 last
season,	 the	 same	 word	 combination	 volume	 was	 exceptionally	 low	 during
March–May,	and	the	price	of	Beacon	Roofing	subsequently	collapsed	by	nearly
50%.

**You	said	earlier	that	there	were	over	a	million	tags	on	TickerTags.	Clearly,
you	can’t	follow	more	than	a	small	sliver	of	these	tags.	How	do	you	decide
which	tags	to	follow,	and	how	do	you	avoid	still	missing	most	opportunities?**

There	is	no	way	I	can	look	at	all	the	granular	tags.	Instead,	I	use	what	I	call
“umbrella	tags.”	These	tags	are	word	combinations	that	allow	me	to	detect	early
on	when	any	topic	is	erupting	on	social	media	and	give	me	insight	into	what
other	tags	I	should	be	looking	at.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	an	umbrella	tag?**

The	word	combination	“obsessed”	plus	“new”	plus	“game”	will	alert	me	when
there	is	any	new	game	that	is	sparking	an	upsurge	in	online	conversation.	So	that
umbrella	 tag	 would	 clue	 me	 in	 as	 to	 what	 specific	 game	 tag	 I	 need	 to	 start
following	at	that	moment,	even	if	I	had	never	heard	of	the	game	before.

**How	 is	 that	 word	 combination	 different	 from	 any	 of	 the	 other	 word
combinations	we	talked	about,	such	as	“gun”	and	“class,”	or	“roof,”	“hail,”
and	“damage”?	What	makes	it	a	so-called	“umbrella	tag”?**

An	umbrella	tag	is	going	to	pick	up	on	anything	in	a	category.	For	example,	if
toys	are	a	category,	I	may	have	hundreds	or	even	thousands	of	related	words	that
I	may	occasionally	look	at.	But	if	I	look	at	the	word	“toy”	and	an	emotional
word,	such	as	“obsessed,”	connected	to	it,	I	will	be	able	to	identify	if	anything	is
happening	in	the	toy	sector	that	is	an	anomaly	that	day.


**So	 an	 umbrella	 tag	 is	 a	 word	 combination	 that	 can	 signal	 something
happening	anywhere	in	an	entire	sector	rather	than	something	specific	to
one	particular	stock?**

Exactly.	 Some	 umbrella	 tags	 are	 even	 more	 general	 than	 a	 sector	 and	 are
intended	to	capture	anything	that	is	trending.

**What	is	an	example	of	a	very	general	umbrella	tag?**

The	phrase	“I	can’t	find”	followed	by	anything.	I’m	pretty	tight-lipped	about	the
exact	umbrella	tags	I	use,	especially	those	that	are	broad	in	coverage.

**What	is	an	example	of	a	trade	that	was	signaled	by	a	general	umbrella	tag?**

A	 few	 years	 ago,	 a	 general	 umbrella	 tag	 uncovered	 a	 spike	 in	 mentions	 of
“Elmer’s	glue.”	At	first,	this	spike	seemed	somewhat	perplexing.	Why	Elmer’s
glue?	Some	further	checking	revealed	that	the	mentions	of	Elmer’s	glue	were
associated	with	DIY	slime	[do-it-yourself	slime].	At	the	time,	there	was	a	big
trend	of	kids	playing	with	slime.	The	main	ingredient	in	slime	is	Elmer’s	glue,
and	Elmer’s	glue	was	selling	out	everywhere.

**Who	makes	Elmer’s	glue?**

Newell	Brands.

**How	big	a	part	of	their	product	line	is	Elmer’s	glue?**

That’s	what’s	interesting.	Elmer’s	glue	was	a	small	piece	of	Newell	Brands,	but
Newell	Brands	was	a	very	slow-growing	company.	Looking	at	how	big	the	trend
in	slime	was,	I	assumed	that	sales	of	Elmer’s	glue	would	increase	by	a	minimum
of	 50%,	 and	 possibly	 as	 much	 as	 100%.	 That	 type	 of	 increase	 would
significantly	move	the	needle	for	the	company	because	their	growth	was	only
about	1.5%	per	year.	Sure	enough,	earnings	were	up	17%	that	quarter,	primarily
because	 of	 the	 increased	 sales	 of	 Elmer’s	 glue.	 I	 am	 so	 proud	 of	 that	 trade
because	no	one	else	following	Newell	Brands	would	have	thought	to	focus	on
sales	of	Elmer’s	glue.

**Can	you	describe	your	trading	process	from	getting	in	to	getting	out?**

Whenever	I	come	across	a	piece	of	information	that	I	think	the	market	doesn’t
know	or	is	not	paying	attention	to,	I	have	to	determine	whether	it	can	move	the
needle	for	the	company.	Sometimes	the	company	is	so	big,	and	the	information
is	 so	 limited	 in	 scope,	 that	 it	 doesn’t	 make	 any	 difference.	 If	 I	 believe	 the
information	could	potentially	be	significant,	I	then	have	to	determine	to	what
degree	it	has	already	been	disseminated	to	the	investment	public.	If	it’s	already
market	 knowledge,	 then	 I	 have	 to	 assume	 it	 is	 reflected	 in	 the	 price.	 If	 the


information	is	both	significant	and	not	yet	disseminated,	I	then	have	to	research
whether	there	might	be	any	extraneous	factors	that	could	meaningfully	impact
the	 company	 during	 the	 time	 window	 of	 my	 trade.	 Is	 there	 any	 impending
lawsuit,	 or	 management	 change,	 or	 new	 product	 line,	 or	 anything	 that	 could
trump	the	information	I	am	trading	on?	Once	I	have	excluded	all	the	factors	that
could	nullify	the	relevance	of	the	information,	I	then	conclude	there	is	what	I
term	an	“information	imbalance.”

What	is	interesting	about	this	methodology	is	that	I	apply	it	completely	blind	to
other	 fundamentals	 in	 the	 company	 and	 the	 price	 action.	 I	 don’t	 care	 if	 the
company	 is	 overvalued	 or	 undervalued.	 I	 assume	 that	 the	 stock	 is	 trading
relatively	efficiently	on	the	information	that	is	out	there.	Then	once	this	new
information	is	added	to	the	picture,	the	stock	should	adjust	accordingly.

The	 last	 step	 is	 to	 define	 the	 trade	 window	 so	 that	 I	 can	 determine	 the
appropriate	option	to	purchase.	For	example,	if	I	were	trading	Disney	based	on
the	expectation	that	a	new	movie	would	be	a	larger-than-expected	hit,	I	would
buy	options	that	expire	beyond	the	opening	weekend.	I	want	to	select	options
that	expire	as	soon	after	the	expected	information	dissemination	as	possible	to
keep	my	option	premium	expenditures	as	low	as	possible.	Typically,	the	option
expiration	will	revolve	around	an	earnings	report,	but	it	could	also	be	determined
by	a	product	release	or	the	availability	of	transactional	data	that	can	be	used	to
anticipate	earnings.	If	there	is	a	reasonable	expectation	for	information	parity
before	the	release	of	earnings,	there	is	a	distinct	advantage	to	purchasing	options
that	 expire	 before	 earnings,	 since	 their	 prices	 won’t	 need	 to	 embed	 the	 extra
volatility	surrounding	an	earnings	release.

**OK,	you	have	described	the	entry	process	for	a	trade.	What	about	the	exit?**

I	 have	 only	 one	 piece	 of	 information	 that	 the	 market	 is	 not	 seeing	 or
appreciating,	but	there	are	lots	of	things	that	could	drive	the	stock	price.	As	an
analogy,	my	methodology	is	like	playing	roulette	and	betting	on	red	because	you
know	 five	 black	 numbers	 have	 been	 removed	 from	 the	 wheel.	 It’s	 not	 that	 I
know	an	investment	is	going	to	work	out;	it’s	a	knowledge	edge.	The	second	the
information	I	am	trading	on	hits	the	street,	whether	it’s	through	analysis	by	a
sell-side	firm,	or	a	media	story,	or	the	company	itself	reporting	it,	I	call	that
“information	 parity,”	 and	 my	 trade	 is	 over.	 I	 must	 sell	 immediately	 when
information	 parity	 happens.	 I	 only	 invest	 when	 there	 is	 an	 information
imbalance,	and	I	must	sell	when	there	is	information	parity.

**Is	that	true	whether	or	not	you’re	making	money	on	the	trade?**


Whether	a	trade	has	a	profit	or	a	loss	at	information	parity	is	entirely	irrelevant.
Either	way,	I	have	to	follow	my	methodology.

**It	sounds	like	you	almost	don’t	need	to	know	what	the	price	is.**

I	don’t	even	want	to	know	what	the	price	is.

**When	did	you	start	your	hedge	fund,	and	why	did	you	close	it?**

As	the	TickerTags	project	was	nearing	completion,	I	thought	I	should	open	a
hedge	fund	because	that	was	what	everyone	was	saying	I	should	do.	They	looked
at	my	returns	and	told	me	that	if	I	could	do	the	same	thing	on	a	larger	scale,	I
could	have	an	incredible	hedge	fund.

**I	would	have	told	you	the	same	thing.**

The	concept	was	that	TickerTags	would	be	the	engine	for	the	hedge	fund.	I	spent
a	year	and	a	half	meeting	with	family	offices,	and	I	lined	up	23	investors,	mostly
in	 the	 Dallas	 area.	 I	 had	 commitments	 for	 almost	 $10	 million.	 I	 spent	 about
$250,000	setting	up	the	fund.	Starting	a	hedge	fund	seemed	really	interesting
because	it	was	what	the	other	side	of	the	business	did,	and	I	was	never	part	of
that	world.

**What	was	your	hedge	fund	called?**

SIA,	which	stood	for	Social	Information	Arbitrage.	We	launched	the	hedge	fund
around	the	same	time	TickerTags	was	in	beta	mode.

**Weren’t	 you	 hesitant	 about	 sharing	 the	 same	 methodology	 through
TickerTags	that	you	were	planning	to	use	for	your	hedge	fund?**

Not	at	all	because	I	thought	the	value	of	TickerTags	would	far	exceed	the	value
of	my	little	hedge	fund.	The	problem	was	that	when	I	took	my	first	week	of
meetings	with	hedge	funds	to	market	TickerTags	as	a	data	product,	they	loved
the	concept,	but	every	fund	I	met	with	told	me	not	to	come	back	as	long	as	I	was
still	running	my	hedge	fund.	They	said	that	they	could	not	take	the	risk	I	might
front-run	the	data	for	my	own	fund	before	they	saw	it.	So	I	was	naïve	to	think
that	I	could	do	both.	Long	story	short,	the	hedge	fund	was	open	for	only	60	days,
and	then	I	had	to	shut	it	down.

**So	you	closed	your	hedge	fund	right	after	opening	it	because	it	impeded	the
TickerTags	venture?**

Right	or	wrong,	that	was	the	decision	that	I	made.

**Did	you	make	any	trades	for	the	hedge	fund	before	you	realized	you	had	to
close	it?**

I	 made	 two	 trades.	 The	 first	 trade	 was	 in	 a	 small	 toy	 company	 called	 Jakks


Pacific.	 The	 trade	 was	 based	 on	 a	 doll	 called	 Snow	 Glow	 Elsa,	 which	 was
affiliated	with	the	Disney	movie	 _Frozen_ .	The	doll	was	released	right	before	the
holiday	season.	It	was	not	only	the	hottest	toy	of	that	holiday	season;	it	was	the
hottest	selling	holiday	toy	in	seven	or	eight	years.

**Since	this	doll	was	associated	with	a	Disney	movie,	wouldn’t	many	other
people	have	been	aware	of	it?**

Not	necessarily	since	there	were	a	lot	of	other	merchandise	items	related	to	the
same	Disney	movie.	It’s	funny	how	people	always	seem	to	congregate	around
one	hot	item.

**Since	this	doll	was	a	new	product,	what	kind	of	tag	would	have	caught	it?**

We	had	tags	for	every	company.	The	researchers	update	each	company	every
quarter	and	add	new	tags	whenever	they	are	meaningful.	So	Snow	Glow	Elsa
was	a	tag.	By	using	all	the	hot-selling	holiday	toys	during	the	past	five	or	six
years	as	benchmarks,	we	could	compare	the	conversational	volume	of	this	toy
versus	the	others.	We	knew	this	toy	was	going	to	be	an	absolute	blockbuster,	and
it	 was.	 It	 was	 a	 very	 high	 conviction	 trade	 that	 met	 the	 critical	 criteria:	 the
market	didn’t	appreciate	the	extent	of	how	hot	this	toy	was	going	to	be,	and	it
moved	the	needle	for	the	company.

**Since	it	was	a	small	company,	it	probably	moved	the	needle	in	a	big	way.**

Huge.	I	was	proud	of	this	trade—my	first	trade	in	my	own	hedge	fund.	I	couldn’t
even	sleep	the	night	before	earnings.	Sure	enough,	the	next	day,	the	company
blows	out	earnings	expectations.	Pre-market,	the	stock	is	trading	up	30%.	I’m	on
top	of	the	world.	All	I	want	to	do	is	impress	my	investors,	all	of	whom	are	local
people	I	know.	Just	before	the	open,	the	stock	drops	30%	in	ten	minutes	in	the
pre-market	and	then	opens	near	unchanged.	Over	the	next	two	hours,	the	stock
goes	down	25%	on	one	of	the	heaviest	trading	days	in	the	company’s	history,
and	I	don’t	have	a	clue	as	to	what	is	happening.	It	made	no	sense	to	me.

Up	to	that	point,	the	company	didn’t	have	a	single	thing	going	for	it.	Now	it	had
the	biggest	toy	product	in	the	world,	and	the	price	was	collapsing.	I	didn’t	find
out	until	two	months	later	what	had	happened.	The	company	had	a	rocky	road	in
the	prior	two	or	three	years.	Their	largest	shareholder,	a	fund	that	owned	11%	of
the	company,	had	sold	off	their	entire	position	that	day.	Jakks	Pacific	was	not	an
actively	traded	stock,	and	this	fund	had	apparently	decided	that	they	would	use
the	first	day	with	good	liquidity	and	strength	to	get	out	of	their	entire	position.

**Wouldn’t	 you	 have	 sold	 your	 position	 after	 the	 earnings	 were	 released,
since,	in	your	words,	it	would	be	a	point	of	“information	parity”?**


I	had	my	full	position	in	slightly	out-of-the-money	options.	Since	the	market
opened	near	even	and	moved	lower,	there	was	no	opportunity	for	me	to	liquidate
my	position.

**So	your	options	lost	100%	of	their	premium.	What	percent	of	your	fund
equity	did	you	lose	on	that	trade?**

It	was	probably	about	4%.	My	second	trade	for	the	fund	ended	up	making	about
the	same	amount.	So,	when	I	closed	the	fund,	it	was	at	about	even.	I	was	the
only	 person	 who	 lost	 money	 in	 my	 fund	 because	 of	 the	 quarter	 of	 a	 million
dollars	I	had	spent	to	structure	the	fund.

**At	the	time	you	lost	your	money	in	that	first	trade,	you	didn’t	yet	know	you
would	be	closing	your	fund.	Did	losing	on	your	first	trade	bother	you?**

It	bothered	me	tremendously.	I	learned	that	I	didn’t	have	what	it	takes	to	run
other	people’s	money.

**So	that	loss	bothered	you	more	than	losing	your	own	money	on	a	trade.**

It	 killed	 me.	 I	 could	 have	 lost	 ten	 times	 that	 amount	 in	 my	 account,	 and	 it
wouldn’t	have	bothered	me	as	much.	I	rarely	take	a	loss	on	a	high-conviction
trade,	and	this	was	as	high	conviction	as	it	gets.	If	I	had	the	opportunity	again,	I
would	make	that	trade	ten	times	over.

**The	approach	you	use	is	entirely	different	from	every	other	trader	I	have
ever	interviewed.	In	what	ways	do	you	consider	yourself	different	from	most
other	traders?**

I	could	never	be	a	good	fundamental	or	technical	trader	because	I	don’t	enjoy
those	methodologies.	The	four	hours	I	spend	every	night	doing	my	analysis	is
something	that	I	love.	I	never	know	when	I’m	going	to	hit	on	that	thing	that	will
take	me	down	the	path	to	my	next	big	trade.	It’s	the	same	feeling	I	had	as	a	kid
going	to	garage	sales.	Every	night	I	start	the	process,	and	I	don’t	know	what	I’m
going	to	find.	I	enjoy	doing	my	nightly	analysis;	that’s	why	I	think	I’m	good	at
it.

The	things	I	do	are	so	different	from	other	traders.	You	would	have	a	hard	time
finding	someone	who	is	more	risk-tolerant	than	I	am.	I	never	use	stop	losses.
Most	 traders	 will	 say,	 “Never	 add	 to	 a	 losing	 position.”	 If	 I	 am	 in	 a	 losing
position	and	nothing	has	changed	in	the	information	dissemination,	I	will	double
down.	I	don’t	care	about	price	action.	Other	traders	want	a	methodology	that	is
systematic	and	regular;	I	am	as	far	removed	from	systematic	and	regular	as	it	is
possible	to	be.


**What	 personal	 traits	 do	 you	 believe	 were	 instrumental	 in	 your	 success?
Which	of	those	traits	were	innate,	and	which	were	learned?**

If	I	were	a	kid	today,	I	think	I	would	be	diagnosed	with	ADD.	I	feel	my	ability	to
focus	on	subject	matter	that	is	of	interest	to	me	is	my	number	one	strength.	The
type	of	analysis	that	I	do	requires	an	immense	amount	of	work	for	something
that	often	doesn’t	have	any	immediate	payoff.	I	could	go	for	months	without
finding	a	high-conviction	trade.

**Is	ADD	the	right	term?	Isn’t	ADD	the	inability	to	focus?**

I	disagree.	ADD	is	the	inability	to	focus	except	for	those	things	you	have	an
innate	interest	in,	in	which	case,	it	works	exactly	the	opposite.

**Any	other	important	traits?**

Patience.	I	know	some	trading	opportunity	will	pop	up	at	some	point,	but	I	don’t
know	when	it’s	going	to	be	or	what	company	it	will	be.	I	know	that	if	I	keep	on
doing	what	I	do	every	day,	it	could	be	tomorrow,	or	it	could	be	four	months	from
now,	I	will	hit	something.	I	just	need	to	have	the	patience	to	wait	for	that	trade.

**Are	you	naturally	a	patient	person?**

Quite	the	opposite.	I	had	virtually	no	patience	when	I	started	trading.	Patience	is
something	that	I	have	slowly	developed	over	the	past	15	years.	Today,	I	am	a
much	 more	 patient	 trader.	 The	 type	 of	 strategy	 I	 use	 requires	 extraordinary
patience.	Ideally,	with	my	methodology,	I	should	be	making	a	trade	only	once
every	 couple	 of	 months,	 and	 it	 is	 hard	 to	 have	 the	 patience	 to	 trade	 that
infrequently	after	doing	all	the	daily	work	I	do.	It’s	still	a	struggle	for	me.

**What	is	your	advice	to	someone	who	wants	to	be	a	trader?**

Don’t	try	to	change	who	you	are	to	match	some	perception	you	might	have	about
what	professional	traders	do	on	Wall	Street.	Don’t	try	to	learn	mathematics	if
you’re	not	a	natural	mathematician.	Don’t	try	to	learn	financial	analysis	if	you
have	no	background	in	it.	There	is	probably	something	in	your	background—
some	area	of	knowledge	or	intense	interest—where	you	are	willing	to	spend	an
inordinate	amount	of	time	to	develop	deep	expertise.	If	that’s	what	you	do,	then
you	can	outsmart	the	generalist,	and	most	market	participants	are	generalists.
You	have	to	find	a	niche	where	you	can	excel.	I	would	ask	a	new	trader:	What	is
your	niche?	Where	is	your	expertise?	What	are	you	willing	to	spend	four	hours	a
day	researching	in	your	off	time	because	it’s	your	passion?	Investing	is	one	of
the	only	industries	in	the	world	where	you	can	take	your	interest	and	monetize	it,
and	that’s	very	exciting	to	me.


To	succeed,	traders	must	find	their	own	market	approach.	Probably	no	one	I	have
ever	interviewed	exemplified	this	principle	more	than	Camillo.	Camillo	not	only
developed	his	own	approach,	he	virtually	invented	an	entirely	different	trading
methodology.	Neither	fundamental	nor	technical	analysis	appealed	to	Camillo,
so	he	came	up	with	a	third	market	analysis	category:	social	arbitrage—profiting
by	spotting	a	societal	shift	or	trend	that	will	impact	a	stock	and	has	not	yet	been
reflected	 by	 the	 stock	 price.	 Initially,	 Camillo	 uncovered	 these	 opportunities
through	 everyday	 observation.	 Eventually,	 after	 developing	 the	 TickerTags
software,	social	media	became	his	primary	tool	for	trade	identification.

OK,	 I	 know	 many	 readers	 are	 probably	 thinking,	 “This	 idea	 of	 using	 social
media	as	a	trading	tool	sounds	appealing,	but	what	good	does	it	do	me	when	I
can’t	 get	 access	 to	 TickerTags?”	 (TickerTags	 is	 only	 available	 to	 institutional
clients.)	 That	 objection	 misses	 the	 more	 general	 point.	 TickerTags	 may	 be	 a
particularly	efficient	way	of	tapping	into	social	and	cultural	trends,	but	it	is	not
the	only	way.	Camillo	was	extremely	successful	in	using	this	general	approach
for	about	a	decade	before	TickerTags	ever	existed.	The	key	lesson	is	that	being
observant	and	highly	attuned	to	new	behavioral	trends,	both	in	your	everyday
life	and	in	social	media,	can	be	a	source	for	uncovering	trading	opportunities.
For	 example,	 consider	 trades	 such	 as	 Cheesecake	 Factory	 and	 P.F.	 Chang’s,
which	 Camillo	 identified	 by	 observing	 Middle	 America’s	 reaction	 to	 these
chains—a	 response	 he	 knew	 Wall	 Street	 would	 be	 blind	 to.	 Observation	 of
consumer	response	to	a	product	can	even	identify	trading	opportunities	in	the
largest	companies,	as	was	the	case	for	Camillo’s	long	position	in	Apple	based	on
his	seeing	how	people	reacted	to	the	first	iPhone.

Question:	 What	 trading	 mistake	 did	 Camillo	 make	 in	 Jakks	 Pacific,	 the	 first
trade	 for	 his	 hedge	 fund,	 in	 which	 his	 long	 call	 positions	 expired	 worthless?
Think	about	it	before	reading	on.

Answer:	 Trick	 question.	 He	 didn’t	 make	 any	 mistake,	 and	 that	 is	 the	 point.
Camillo	followed	his	methodology	precisely,	and	he	placed	a	high-conviction
trade—the	type	of	trade	that	had	a	demonstrated	history	of	strong	net	success.	In
this	particular	instance,	a	completely	unforeseeable	event—the	total	liquidation
of	 a	 position	 by	 the	 company’s	 largest	 shareholder—caused	 the	 profit	 on	 the
trade	to	be	reversed	in	an	instant.	Sometimes,	even	the	best-planned	trade	can
fail.	Such	a	trade	will	be	a	losing	trade,	but	it	is	not	a	bad	trade.	On	the	contrary,


if	Camillo	repeatedly	takes	such	trades,	he	will	come	out	way	ahead,	and	it	is
impossible	to	tell	a	priori	which	of	those	trades	will	end	up	losing.	The	lesson	is:
Don’t	confuse	a	losing	trade	with	a	bad	trade—they	are	not	necessarily	the	same
thing.	Losing	trades	can	be	good	trades,	and,	similarly,	winning	trades	can	be
bad	trades.

Don’t	 ever	 listen	 to	 anybody	 when	 you	 are	 in	 a	 position.	 Stick	 to	 your	 own
approach	and	avoid	being	influenced	by	contradictory	opinions.	Camillo’s	most
regretful	trade	was	one	in	which	he	allowed	himself	to	be	swayed	by	conflicting
market	opinions	into	liquidating	two-thirds	of	his	Under	Armour	call	position	at
a	loss,	only	to	then	see	his	original	trade	premise	fully	validated.	Camillo	learned
his	 lesson,	 and	 when	 a	 similar	 situation	 arose	 when	 he	 was	 long	 Netflix,	 he
ignored	the	conflicting	opinions.	In	my	experience	as	well,	it	is	amazing	how
catastrophic	listening	to	other	opinions	can	be.

Patience	to	wait	for	the	right	trade	opportunity	has	been	cited	as	a	valuable	trait
by	multiple	traders	I	have	interviewed.	It	is	also	one	of	the	most	challenging
qualities	to	acquire.	Camillo	believes	that	he	would	have	done	far	better	if	he
restricted	 his	 market	 activity	 to	 his	 high-conviction	 trades.	 He	 states,	 “My
biggest	mistakes	over	the	years	have	always	been	a	consequence	of	trading	too
much.”	Camillo’s	problem	is	that	the	high-conviction	trades	he	favors	may	come
along	 only	 once	 every	 couple	 of	 months	 or	 even	 less	 frequently.	 He	 finds	 it
difficult	to	spend	four	hours	a	day	searching	for	and	researching	trades	and	then
waiting	for	months	to	place	a	trade.	But	Camillo	is	mindful	of	the	importance	of
being	more	patient	and	believes	his	improvement	in	this	regard	over	the	years
has	enhanced	his	trading	success.

Not	all	trades	are	the	same.	As	is	the	case	for	Camillo,	many	traders	may	have
trades	 that	 vary	 in	 their	 perceived	 probability	 of	 success.	 There	 is	 a	 middle
ground	 between	 taking	 all	 prospective	 trades	 generated	 by	 a	 trader’s	 specific
methodology	and	taking	only	perceived	high-probability	trades.	Alternatively,	a
trader	can	vary	the	position	size,	taking	larger	positions	on	higher-probability
trades	and	smaller	positions	on	lower	probability	trades.

Confidence	is	one	of	the	best	indicators	of	future	trading	success.	The	Market
Wizards	tend	to	be	highly	confident	in	their	ability	to	continue	to	win	in	the
markets,	and	Camillo	certainly	fits	this	description.	He	exudes	confidence	in	his
methodology	and	firmly	believes	it	will	continue	to	provide	him	with	a	clear
edge	in	the	markets.	As	well	as	he	has	done	so	far,	he	expects	to	do	even	better
in	the	future.	One	way	traders	can	ascertain	how	likely	they	are	to	succeed	in	the


markets	is	to	gauge	their	level	of	confidence.	Traders	should	ask	themselves:
“Am	 I	 confident	 that	 my	 trading	 methodology	 and	 process	 will	 make	 me	 a
winner	in	the	markets?”	If	the	answer	is	anything	less	than	an	emphatic	“yes,”
they	should	stringently	limit	their	risk	capital	until	they	achieve	a	higher	level	of
confidence	in	their	approach.

Camillo	made	his	first	trade	when	he	was	14.	I	have	found	that	many	of	the
highly	successful	traders	I	have	interviewed	developed	their	interest	in	trading
and	markets	at	an	early	age.	Traders	who	fit	this	profile	probably	have	a	better-
than-average	chance	for	success.

Successful	 traders	 love	 what	 they	 do.	 Camillo	 succeeded	 because	 he	 found	 a
way	 of	 approaching	 the	 markets	 that	 resonated	 with	 his	 natural	 interests	 and
passions—indeed,	his	methodology	even	echoed	his	childhood	entrepreneurial
pursuits.	Both	fundamental	and	technical	analysis	left	him	cold,	and	if	he	had
pursued	those	traditional	paths,	he	most	likely	would	have	failed.


# Marsten	Parker: 	Don’t	Quit	Your	Day	Job

When	I	interviewed	Ed	Seykota	for	my	book,	 _Market	Wizards_ ,^16 	I	asked	him,
“What	are	the	trading	rules	you	live	by?”	Two	of	the	rules	he	mentioned	were:

```
1 .	Follow	the	rules	without	question.
2 .	Know	when	to	break	the	rules.
```
These	lines	came	to	mind	when	I	interviewed	Marsten	Parker	because	his	trading
story	is	a	testament	to	the	truth	inherent	in	Seykota’s	reply,	notwithstanding	its
superficial	facetious	appearance.

When	I	first	looked	at	Parker’s	performance	statistics,	my	initial	response	was
that	I	probably	would	not	include	him	in	this	book.	Although	his	track	record
was	certainly	good,	neither	his	return	nor	his	return/risk	statistics	were	close	to
the	 spectacular	 levels	 achieved	 by	 most	 of	 the	 other	 traders	 I	 had	 already
interviewed	or	was	scheduled	to	interview.	But	then	I	noted	that	Parker’s	track
record	was	22	years	long,	a	substantially	longer	period	than	most	of	the	other
traders	I	had	decided	to	include—an	important	consideration	that	should	not	be
ignored.	I	reconsidered.

Parker’s	average	annual	compounded	return	during	the	past	20	years	was	20.0%,
more	than	triple	the	5.7%	return	of	the	S&P	500	total	return	index	during	the

corresponding	period.^17 	His	return/risk	numbers	were	solid:	an	adjusted	Sortino
ratio	of	1.05	and	a	monthly	Gain	to	Pain	ratio	of	1.24,	approximately	triple	the

corresponding	S&P	index	levels.^18 	I	realized	that	I	was	becoming	overcritical	in
my	 selection	 process,	 spoiled	 by	 some	 of	 the	 extraordinary	 results	 posted	 by
other	 traders	 I	 had	 found.	 Ninety-nine	 percent	 plus	 of	 professional	 equity
managers	would	be	thrilled	to	have	a	20-year	record	of	trouncing	the	S&P	500
by	similar	margins.

There	was	another	factor	that	was	instrumental	in	my	decision	to	include	Parker.
He	was	the	only	purely	systematic	trader	I	had	found	whose	performance	was
sufficiently	 superior	 to	 even	 merit	 consideration	 for	 inclusion.	 Perhaps	 the
lopsided	overrepresentation	of	discretionary	versus	systematic	traders	I	found	in
my	search	for	exceptional	performance	is	not	representative	of	the	total	trader
population,	but	I	suspect	it	is.	Ever	since	the	release	of	my	first	 _Market	Wizards_
book	 in	 1989,	 I	 had	 found	 that	 standout	 individual	 traders	 tended	 to	 be


discretionary,	and	this	bias	seems	to	have	become	even	more	pronounced	over
the	years.	There	may	be	many	systematic	traders	who	are	profitable,	but	few	that
outperform	 benchmarks	 by	 wide	 margins	 over	 long	 periods.	 I	 felt	 it	 was
desirable	to	include	a	strictly	systematic	trader	who	had	successfully	earned	a
living	by	trading.

In	contrast	to	most	of	the	successful	traders	I’ve	interviewed,	Parker	had	no	early
interest	in	the	markets.	His	passion	was	music,	not	trading.	His	original	life	goal
was	to	be	a	professional	violinist.	He	attended	the	Mannes	School	of	Music	in
New	York,	but,	while	there,	he	realized	that	he	was	not	good	enough	to	succeed
as	a	professional	classical	musician.	Although	music	would	remain	an	essential
part	of	his	life—he	is	the	concertmaster	for	a	community	orchestra	in	Newton,
Massachusetts—it	would	be	a	dead	end	career-wise.

The	path	that	eventually	led	Parker	to	trading	began	with	another	early	passion:
computer	programming.	His	initial	interest	was	sparked	in	ninth	grade	in	the	pre-
PC	era.	Parker’s	school	had	a	Data	General	Nova	computer,	which	provided	his
first	exposure	to	programming.	His	interest	in	programming	was	rekindled	in
college	through	access	to	a	computer	lab	and	abetted	by	a	free	DEC	VT-180	PC
his	mother	had	arranged	for	him	to	receive.	This	hobby	led	to	a	programming
career	and,	eventually,	systematic	trading.

Parker’s	trading	career	could	be	divided	into	three	distinct	phases:	an	initial	14-
year	period	of	consistent	profitability;	a	subsequent	three-year	period	that	very
nearly	 drove	 him	 to	 quit	 trading	 permanently;	 and	 the	 most	 recent	 four-year
period	when	he	achieved	his	best	return/risk	numbers	ever.

I	interviewed	Parker	in	his	home	office.	One	of	his	two	cats	had	a	fondness	for
jumping	on	the	desk.	I	kept	a	wary	eye	on	her,	concerned	she	might	step	on	the
stop	button	of	my	recorder,	causing	an	unintended	paws	pause.	Parker	recorded
every	trade	he	ever	made,	and	his	custom-built	software	program	allows	him	to
generate	 year-by-year	 profit/loss	 charts,	 segmented	 by	 trading	 system	 and	 by
long	 and	 short	 trades.	 He	 continually	 used	 these	 programs	 to	 generate
performance	charts	as	we	walked	through	his	trading	career	in	the	interview.

**How	did	you	go	from	being	a	violinist	seeking	a	career	as	a	professional
musician	to	becoming	a	trader?**

In	high	school,	there	were	two	things	I	was	really	into—one	was	violin,	and	the


other	was	computer	programming.	I	tried	to	get	into	Juilliard	but	didn’t	make	it.
So	I	went	to	Mannes	School	of	Music,	which	was	my	fallback	choice,	and	I	was
probably	 one	 of	 the	 worst	 players	 there.	 Although	 I	 kept	 trying,	 I	 realized	 I
wasn’t	 going	 to	 be	 a	 star.	 I	 thought	 about	 switching	 colleges	 to	 major	 in
computer	programming,	but,	by	that	point,	I	was	already	in	my	junior	year,	and	I
thought	I	might	as	well	finish	my	degree.

**What	prior	experience	did	you	have	with	computers?**

My	first	exposure	to	computers	was	in	ninth	grade.	They	had	a	refrigerator-sized
computer	 at	 my	 high	 school,	 and	 we	 were	 required	 to	 do	 some	 BASIC
programming	for	algebra	class.	I	thought	it	was	a	lot	of	fun,	so	I	kept	going	back
to	the	computer	room.	You	typed	your	program	on	a	Teletype.	If	you	wanted	to
save	your	program,	you	had	to	print	it	out	on	a	roll	of	paper	this	long	[he	spreads
his	hands	out	wide	apart].	I	carried	around	a	box	with	little	rolls	of	paper	tape,
which	 was	 my	 software	 library.	 Then	 I	 shifted	 my	 focus	 to	 the	 violin,	 and	 I
didn’t	do	much	with	computers	for	the	rest	of	high	school.

I	got	back	into	computers	when	I	was	in	college.	Mannes	had	an	arrangement
that	 allowed	 students	 to	 take	 courses	 at	 Marymount	 Manhattan	 College.	 I
discovered	Marymount	had	a	computer	lab	with	Apple	IIs,	and	I	spent	a	lot	of
time	 there	 playing	 around	 with	 them.	 My	 mother	 worked	 at	 an	 advertising
agency,	and	her	most	important	client	was	Digital.	She	mentioned	my	interest	in
computers	to	one	of	their	vice	presidents,	and	he	said,	“I	have	a	spare	one;	I’ll
send	it	to	him.”	After	that	computer	arrived	at	my	apartment	in	New	York,	I
knew	that	programming,	rather	than	music,	was	what	I	wanted	to	do.

**What	did	you	do	after	you	graduated?**

After	I	graduated,	I	moved	back	to	Boston.	I	had	no	idea	what	I	was	going	to	do.
I	ended	up	taking	a	job	in	a	computer	software	store.	It	was	the	early	1980s
when	the	PC	was	just	in	its	early	days.

**Did	 you	 have	 any	 idea	 of	 what	 you	 wanted	 to	 do	 with	 your	 life?	 I	 am
assuming	that	being	a	salesman	in	the	computer	store	wasn’t	it.**

No,	 at	 that	 point,	 I	 was	 floundering.	 I	 was	 spending	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 writing
programs.

**What	kind	of	programs?**

I	 programmed	 some	 fun	 stuff	 like	 games.	 I	 also	 wrote	 a	 program	 to	 do	 my
accounting.	I	did	this	programming	on	a	primitive	computer	that	had	only	64K
of	memory.	I	remember	spending	$1,000	for	a	10	MB	hard	drive.


**How	long	did	you	stay	at	the	computer	store	job?**

I	was	there	for	only	a	few	months.	By	pure	chance,	I	met	the	president	of	a	small
software	 company	 called	 Cortex	 at	 a	 party.	 The	 company	 had	 about	 20
employees,	and	he	offered	to	get	me	an	interview	with	their	tech	guys.

**Had	you	tried	to	get	a	programming	job	after	you	graduated	college	before
taking	the	computer	store	job?**

No,	because	I	had	assumed	I	couldn’t	get	a	job	as	a	programmer	since	I	was	just
an	amateur.

**What	happened	at	the	interview?**

I	brought	along	some	of	the	programs	I	had	written	for	myself.	They	looked	at
the	code	and	said,	“Oh,	you	have	some	talent.	We’ll	give	you	a	try.”	They	hired
me	at	a	low	salary,	similar	to	an	intern	level.	But	they	gave	me	two	raises	in	the
first	year	to	get	me	up	to	a	level	so	that	I	would	stay.	I	stayed	there	for	five	years.

**Why	did	you	leave?**

Cortex	developed	software	for	DEC	VAX	minicomputers,	and	I	wanted	to	work
more	on	PCs,	so	I	took	a	job	at	Softbridge,	a	company	with	about	100	employees
that	was	more	PC-focused.	I	stayed	with	them	for	three	years	until	1991.	When
we	found	out	that	our	entire	group	was	going	to	be	laid	off,	our	group	leader
made	contact	with	a	small	startup	called	Segue	Software,	which	had	a	contract
with	Lotus	to	port	their	spreadsheet	software	to	Unix.	Four	of	us	formed	a	group
called	Software	Quality	Management.	We	were	subcontractors	to	Segue,	who
were	contractors	to	Lotus.	They	hired	us	to	be	the	QA	[quality	assurance]	group
for	the	project.

In	those	days,	most	software	testing	was	done	manually,	which	was	a	very	time-
consuming	 and	 error-prone	 process.	 We	 created	 software	 that	 automated	 the
testing	 using	 a	 methodology	 that	 we	 were	 able	 to	 patent.	 Ultimately,	 Segue
agreed	to	buy	our	technology	in	exchange	for	stock,	and	our	group	was	merged
into	Segue.	An	interesting	side	note	is	that	Jim	Simons	of	Renaissance	was	the
principal	investor	in	Segue	and	was	involved	in	the	merger	negotiations,	which
resulted	in	our	getting	stock	in	Segue	in	exchange	for	our	technology.

**At	the	time,	did	you	know	who	Simons	was?**

Someone	told	me	he	was	a	rich	guy	who	was	a	commodity	trader.	I	didn’t	even
know	what	a	commodity	trader	was.	I	remember	that	we	had	a	strict	no	smoking
policy,	and	Simons	was	the	one	exception.

**How	did	you	make	the	transition	from	programming	to	trading?**


There	was	a	brief	time	in	1995	when	we	had	the	leading	QA	software,	which
coincided	with	a	time	when	virtually	any	technology	company	could	go	public.
Segue	IPO’d	in	1996	(ticker	symbol:	SEGU).	The	stock	opened	at	$23	and	then,
in	just	over	a	month,	rallied	to	a	high	over	$40.	At	the	high,	my	stake	in	Segue
was	worth	about	$6	million.	I	couldn’t	sell	any	stock,	though,	because	we	were
still	in	the	six-month	lock-up	period	when	employees	aren’t	allowed	to	sell	their
stock.	Shortly	afterward,	there	was	a	correction	in	NASDAQ	stocks,	and	some
large	 customers	 delayed	 their	 buy	 orders,	 forcing	 us	 to	 issue	 an	 earnings
warning.	 In	 two	 months,	 Segue	 fell	 from	 its	 high	 just	 over	 $40	 to	 $10.	 I
eventually	sold	out	of	my	stock	during	1997	and	1998	at	an	average	price	of
about	$13.	I	left	Segue	at	the	end	of	1997	to	trade.

**You	left	to	trade.	How	did	you	get	interested	in	the	market?**

I	got	interested	after	my	company	went	public.	I	owned	about	150,000	shares,	so
I	was	very	motivated	to	watch	the	stock	price	every	day.

**I	understand	that	with	virtually	your	entire	wealth	tied	up	in	the	IPO	shares
that	you	started	monitoring	the	price	of	the	stock.	But	how	did	you	go	from
there	to	the	idea	that	you	could	trade	for	a	living?**

That	didn’t	happen	right	away.	One	of	the	board	members	of	the	local	orchestra	I
played	for	was	a	CPA.	The	first	thing	I	did	was	to	go	to	him	for	advice.	He
referred	me	to	a	financial	planner	who	gave	me	the	usual	financial	planner’s
spiel	about	how	the	stock	market	goes	up	11%	per	year	and	will	do	that	forever.
He	explained	how	I	could	pay	him	2%	per	year	to	put	my	money	in	mutual	funds
that	also	charged	2%	per	year.	That	plan	didn’t	make	a	lot	of	sense	to	me.	I
started	 going	 to	 the	 bookstore,	 browsing	 through	 the	 investment	 section,	 and
buying	trading	books.	One	of	the	first	books	I	bought	was	 _Trading	for	a	Living_
by	Alexander	Elder.	I	saw	the	title	and	thought,	“Oh,	people	trade	for	a	living.
What	a	concept!”

**When	you	left	your	job,	did	you	have	any	idea	about	how	you	were	going	to
trade?**

It	was	all	very	clueless.	I	didn’t	have	a	plan.	I	just	had	this	vague	intuition	that	I
could	learn	how	to	trade	because	I	was	interested	in	it.	I	thought	it	would	be	fun.
I	also	liked	the	idea	of	having	more	time	to	spend	with	my	family	and	practice
the	violin.	It	was	just	an	experiment.	I	assumed	I	could	always	get	another	job.

I	 also	 developed	 a	 correspondence	 with	 Gary	 B.	 Smith,	 who	 was	 writing	 a
column	 called	 Technician’s	 Take	 for	 TheStreet.com.	 His	 method	 was	 an
adaptation	of	William	O’Neil’s	CANSLIM	method,	minus	all	the	fundamental


inputs	 and	 using	 much	 closer	 profit	 targets.^19 Gary	 described	 the	 strategy	 in
several	 of	 his	 articles.	 It	 was	 the	 first	 time	 I	 had	 come	 across	 a	 detailed
description	 of	 a	 systematic	 approach	 to	 trading,	 and	 it	 appealed	 to	 me.	 So	 I
started	emailing	him	and	soon	became	his	trading	partner.

In	 February	 1998,	 I	 decided	 to	 start	 trading	 using	 his	 method,	 which	 was
partially	 discretionary	 and	 partially	 mechanical.	 The	 exits	 were	 fully	 defined.
Once	you	were	in	a	position,	you	would	place	a	bracket	exit	order	with	a	target
that	was	5%	higher	and	a	stop	that	was	7%	lower	(assuming	a	long	position).
The	 strategy	 would	 take	 both	 longs	 and	 shorts,	 and	 the	 main	 criterion	 was
unusual	 volume.	 We	 both	 subscribed	 to	 _Investor’s	 Business	 Daily_ ,	 and	 they
published	a	table	of	stocks	that	had	unusually	high	volume	on	the	previous	day
—basically,	stocks	with	a	high	ratio	of	the	previous	day’s	volume	to	the	past	20-
day	average	daily	volume.

**What	would	qualify	as	a high	ratio?**

Volume	that	was	two	times	or	more	the	recent	average.	We	would	look	up	all	the
stocks	in	that	table	and	filter	out	stocks	whose	relative	strength	was	less	than	80
[stocks	that	had	not	outperformed	at	least	80%	of	other	stocks	during	the	past	52
weeks].	 So	 basically,	 we	 were	 looking	 for	 strong-performing	 stocks	 that	 had
unusually	high	volume	on	the	previous	day.	These	two	conditions	would	narrow
down	the	list	of	stocks	considered	for	a	trade	to	about	20	or	30.	Here	is	where
the	 discretionary	 part	 would	 come	 in.	 We	 would	 review	 the	 charts	 of	 those
stocks,	 looking	 for	 stocks	 that	 had	 recent	 breakouts	 to	 new	 highs	 from	 prior
consolidation	periods.

**You	mentioned	that	you	traded	both	longs	and	shorts.	Were	the	sell	signal
conditions	just	the	reverse	of	the	buy	signals?**

No.	The	preconditions	were	the	same	as	the	longs—we	were	still	surveying	only
strong-performing	stocks	that	had	abnormal	volume.	The	difference	was	that	for
shorts,	 we	 were	 looking	 for	 stocks	 that	 had	 a	 sharp	 breakdown	 from	 recent
highs,	as	opposed	to	a	breakout	to	new	lows.

**I	assume	what	you	just	described	was	Gary	Smith’s	method.	What	did	you
bring	to	the	table?**

Initially,	I	didn’t	contribute	much.	I	was	mainly	following	his	trades.	But	after
we	had	traded	together	for	a	month	for	two,	I	said,	“Why	don’t	we	try	to	test	this
method?”	So	I	brought	backtesting	to	the	table.	As	we	went	along,	to	me,	the
process	of	looking	at	charts	and	deciding	which	trade	to	take	seemed	arbitrary.	I
wanted	to	test	things.	I	didn’t	feel	comfortable	assuming	some	pattern	worked


just	because	somebody	said	so.	I	wanted	to	be	able	to	quantify	it.

**What	was	Gary’s	response	when	you	suggested	testing	the	methodology?**

He	liked	the	idea.	My	idea	for	testing	probably	came	up	during	a	drawdown.
That’s	what	always	motivates	people	to	do	testing	[he	laughs].	The	first	thing	I
did	was	to	test	different	target	exits	and	stop	levels.	This	computer	testing	was
my	first	step	down	the	path	towards	naïve,	over-optimized	system	development.
It	was	very	exciting	to	backtest	and	find	out	what	would	have	worked	best.	At
that	point,	I	didn’t	have	a	clue	about	the	dangers	of	curve	fitting	and	data	mining.
I	naïvely	assumed	that	what	had	worked	best	in	the	past	would	continue	to	work
best	in	the	future.

**Did	anything	useful	come	out	of	that	initial	testing?**

I	realized	that	using	stops	was	detrimental	to	the	system.

**So	how	did	you	get	out	of	positions	if	your	profit	target	wasn’t	hit?**

I	would	use	a	stop,	but	it	was	only	activated	on	the	close.

**Oh,	so	you	didn’t	eliminate	stops,	you	eliminated	intraday	stops.**

That’s	right.	I	found	that	by	using	intraday	stops,	I	was	getting	stopped	out	a	lot
on	meaningless	intraday	volatility.

**Were	there	any	other	significant	changes	that	resulted	from	your	initial
backtesting	efforts?**

The	most	significant	impact	was	that	once	I	got	involved	in	building	backtesting
software,	I	became	obsessed	with	it.	At	heart,	I	am	more	of	a	software	developer
than	 a	 trader.	 By	 mid-1999,	 I	 had	 become	 skeptical	 that	 there	 was	 any
connection	 between	 how	 nice	 a	 chart	 pattern	 looked	 and	 the	 probability	 of	 a
successful	trade.	I	wanted	to	delegate	chart	evaluation	to	my	software.	Gary’s
trading	identity,	however,	was	built	around	how	good	he	was	at	looking	at	charts.
By	that	time,	he	had	started	a	subscription	service	called	 _Chartman_ ,	and	he	was
putting	out	trading	recommendations	every	day.	So,	although	we	stayed	in	touch,
we	each	went	our	own	way.

**Had	you	developed	a	specific	system	that	you	were	trading?**

I	didn’t	make	an	abrupt,	full	transition	to	mechanical	trading.	Through	most	of
1999,	I	was	developing	the	software	and	continually	tweaking	my	trading	rules,
while	still	allowing	some	discretion.	By	the	end	of	November,	I	was	up	about
20%	year	to	date,	all	of	the	profits	coming	from	short	trades.	I	got	cocky	and
increased	both	the	size	and	frequency	of	my	short	trades	in	December,	just	in
time	to	catch	an	upside	surge	in	stocks.	During	that	last	month,	I	ended	up	giving


back	almost	all	my	profits	for	the	year.	My	long	trades,	meanwhile,	actually	lost
money	in	1999—a	rare	feat.	That	experience	permanently	soured	me	on	being	a
semi-discretionary	trader,	and	I	resolved	to	trade	100%	mechanically	from	that
point	on.

**Was	the	system	still	based	on	the	trading	method	you	learned	from	Gary?**

Pretty	much.	My	first	independent	backtesting	discovery	that	I	used	profitably
was	the	observation	that	the	further	a	stock	dropped	on	the	first	day,	the	more
likely	it	was	to	continue	falling.	It	was	a	finding	I	didn’t	want	to	believe	because,
instinctively,	 I	 thought	 the	 larger	 the	 initial	 drop,	 the	 more	 the	 stock	 was
oversold.	 At	 first,	 I	 didn’t	 even	 test	 for	 unusually	 large	 declines	 on	 the	 first
breakdown	day.	I	had	restricted	my	test	to	a	range	of	declines	between	2%	and
6%.	Then	I	thought,	“Why	not	go	all	the	way?”	I	found	that	if	there	was	a	20%
drop	 on	 the	 first	 day,	 there	 was	 a	 very	 high	 probability	 of	 a	 continued	 price
decline.

**I’m	curious,	is	that	particular	characteristic	still	valid	in	the	markets?**

No,	although,	initially,	that	pattern	worked	very	well.	From	2000	to	2012,	I	made
more	than	half	my	profits	from	the	short	side	using	that	strategy.	But	then	in
2013,	it	stopped	working.

**We’ll	get	there.	In	your	first	system,	were	there	as	many	shorts	as	longs?**

No,	because	since	the	system	needed	a	more	significant	break	on	the	downside
for	 short	 entries	 than	 upmove	 for	 long	 entries,	 there	 were	 only	 about	 half	 as
many	short	trades.

My	methodology	as	it	was	evolving	then,	which	I	now	understand	is	somewhat
flawed,	was	to	run	a	system	until	it	had	a	drawdown,	then	backtest	and	find
different	parameters	that	wouldn’t	have	had	that	drawdown,	and	switch	to	those
parameters.	 [A	 _parameter_ is	 a	 value	 that	 can	 be	 freely	 assigned	 in	 a	 trading
system	 to	 vary	 the	 timing	 of	 signals.	 For	 example,	 if	 a	 system	 required	 a
specified	percentage	price	decline	on	a	given	day	to	generate	a	sell	signal,	the
percentage	 would	 be	 a	 parameter	 value.	 The	 same	 system	 would	 generate
different	signals	for	different	parameter	values.]

**Besides	 trading	 a	 fixed	 set	 of	 parameters	 until	 you	 had	 a	 significant
drawdown,	what	was	the	specific	system	you	were	trading	in	2000	when	you
first	adopted	a	fully	systematic	approach?**

I	kept	every	system	that	I	ever	traded.	[Parker	searches	his	computer	to	find	the
exact	system	he	traded	in	2000.]	In	2000,	all	the	system	profits	came	from	the
short	 side.	 Here	 are	 the	 complete	 rules	 for	 the	 short	 signals	 for	 the	 system	 I


traded	throughout	2000:

```
The	average	daily	volume	had	to	be	at	least	250,000	shares.
The	price	per	share	had	to	be	at	least	$10	and	no	more	than	$150.
The	 breakdown	 day’s	 volume	 had	 to	 be	 at	 least	 15%	 greater	 than	 the
highest	volume	during	the	past	20	days.
The	price	had	to	drop	at	least	5%	after	having	been	within	5%	of	a	20-day
high	or	10%	after	having	been	within	10%	of	a	20-day	high.
The	price	break	had	to	be	at	least	$1.50	per	share.
I	would	exit	the	trade	either	at	a	12%	profit	target	or	a	$3	stop—that’s	a
very	arbitrary	stop	[he	says	this	in	a	surprised	and	amused	tone,	seeing	this
rule	for	the	first	time	in	many	years].	There	was	an	additional	exit	rule	to
liquidate	the	position	on	any	up	day	with	a	higher	volume	than	the	previous
day.
```
**How	long	did	you	trade	this	system	before	making	any	significant	change?**

It	was	only	about	a	year.	Although	the	system	did	very	well	in	2000—in	fact,	it
was	my	best	calendar	year	ever—it	had	about	a	20%	drawdown	in	early	2001.	I
thought,	“Well,	that	doesn’t	work	anymore.	I	guess	I’ll	have	to	quit.”	It	looks
like	I	stopped	trading	for	over	a	month.	[He	points	to	the	equity	curve	chart	on
his	screen,	which	goes	flat	in	March	2001.]	I	had	been	entering	trades	on	the
opening	of	the	following	day.	The	most	significant	change	I	made	was	to	run	the
system	about	20	minutes	before	the	close	so	that	I	could	enter	trades	on	the	close
of	the	same	day	as	the	signal.	I	had	developed	an	understanding	that	the	pace	of
the	markets	was	speeding	up.

I	used	the	same	basic	system,	executing	on	the	close,	from	March	2001	through

2004.	 Then	 in	 early	 2005,	 I	 had	 another	 drawdown,	 and	 I	 couldn’t	 find	 any
parameters	for	my	system	that	would	have	avoided	that	loss.	I	realized	that	even
entering	on	the	close	was	not	quick	enough	and	that	I	had	to	detect	the	signals
earlier	in	the	day.	I	came	up	with	the	innovation	of	using	a	stock’s	volume	as	of
each	minute	of	the	day	to	project	its	daily	volume.	For	those	stocks	that	had
projections	 for	 an	 abnormally	 high	 volume	 day,	 I	 would	 then	 use	 the	 same
formula	I	had	been	using	to	generate	trade	signals.	So	starting	at	9:35	a.m.	and
each	 minute	 after	 that,	 if	 based	 on	 its	 projected	 daily	 volume	 a	 given	 stock
fulfilled	the	conditions	for	a	trade,	I	would	buy	or	short	it	then.


**And	did	that	change	help?**

I	made	the	change	in	May	2005.	Not	only	was	the	revised	system	immediately
profitable,	 but	 the	 24-month	 period	 between	 October	 2005	 and	 October	 2007
was	the	most	profitable	period	of	my	entire	trading	career.

**What	happened	to	the	system	version	that	executed	on	the	close?**

It	 never	 recovered.	 In	 2014,	 as	 part	 of	 a	 presentation	 I	 gave,	 I	 generated	 an
equity	chart	of	the	original	system	with	executions	on	the	close	going	back	to	the
mid-1990s	through	the	then-current	year.	It	looked	like	the	system	executing	on
the	close	hit	a	brick	wall	in	early	2005.	In	the	decade	before,	it	had	made	steady
profits;	after	early	2005,	it	steadily	lost	money.	In	my	entire	history	of	testing
trading	systems,	I	have	never	seen	such	a	sharp	turning	point.	It	wasn’t	just	a
matter	of	having	the	wrong	parameters;	the	system	with	executions	on	the	close
just	stopped	working.

**So	you	are	saying	that	during	the	same	period	you	were	experiencing	the
best	performance	of	your	trading	career,	the	same	system	executing	on	the
close,	instead	of	throughout	the	day,	would	have	lost	money.	Transacting
during	the	day	made	that	much	difference?**

Yes.	I	typically	had	over	a	thousand	trades	per	year,	so	the	expected	profit	per
trade	was	pretty	low.	Little	things	could	make	a	big	difference.

**So	 the	 entire	 profitability	 of	 the	 system	 was	 dependent	 on	 executing
intraday	rather	than	waiting	for	the	close.	Did	it	give	you	any	hesitation
that	the	system	was	so	tenuous	that	if	you	executed	a	few	hours	later	it
would	have	been	a	losing	strategy?**

No,	because	I	try	to	think	about	why	a	system	is	working	and	what	the	edge	is.	I
had	observed	that	trading	was	speeding	up.	High-frequency	trading	had	entered
into	the	picture.	Mutual	funds	had	mostly	transitioned	from	human	execution	to
executing	 algorithmically	 throughout	 the	 day.	 It	 made	 sense	 that	 executing
quicker	could	make	a	big	difference.	In	those	days,	I	would	say,	“The	only	edge
is	being	early.”

**How	long	did	this	basic	system	with	intraday	executions	continue	to	work?**

In	 August	 2011,	 the	 stock	 market	 had	 a	 massive	 decline.	 Although	 I	 had	 a
significant	 loss	 in	 my	 long	 positions,	 it	 was	 offset	 by	 the	 gain	 in	 my	 short
positions.	That	is	how	the	strategy	is	supposed	to	work—that	is,	if	the	market
has	a	major	move,	one	side	should	compensate	for	the	other.	In	2012,	however,	I
noticed	 that	 the	 short	 side	 was	 not	 doing	 its	 job.	 It	 didn’t	 have	 a	 major
drawdown,	but	it	wasn’t	protecting	against	losses	on	the	long	side	the	way	it


should	have.	Late	2012	marked	the	beginning	of	an	extended	drawdown	in	my
short	strategy.	That	was	effectively	the	end	of	my	short	strategy	working.

**Of	course,	now	we	are	talking	with	the	benefit	of	hindsight.	When	did	you
eventually	decide	the	system	was	no	longer	working,	and	what	did	you	do?**

I’ve	always	struggled	with	how	to	distinguish	between	a	routine	drawdown	and	a
system	that	has	stopped	working.	The	system	had	done	well	for	many	years,	so	I
was	 reluctant	 to	 abandon	 it	 right	 away	 just	 because	 I	 had	 a	 feeling	 that
something	 wasn’t	 right.	 2013	 was	 a	 year	 when	 anybody	 should	 have	 made
money	on	the	long	side.	The	stock	indexes	went	straight	up	with	virtually	no
significant	drawdowns.	My	long	positions	underperformed	the	index,	and	my
short	positions	got	destroyed.	It	was	my	first	losing	year.

**Well,	with	the	stock	index	going	straight	up,	the	steady	losses	in	your	short
positions	are	explainable.**

Yes,	but	in	other	past	years	when	the	index	had	gone	up,	my	short	positions	were
closer	to	even.	If	you	backtest	long	mean-reversion	strategies	for	2013,	you	will
find	 they	 did	 great.	 [Mean-reversion	 systems	 sell	 on	 strength	 and	 buy	 on
weakness	 based	 on	 the	 assumption	 that	 prices	 will	 pull	 back	 to	 some	 period
average.]	 It	 was	 the	 period	 when	 people	 introduced	 the	 term	 BTFD	 (buy	 the
fucking	dip).	What	was	happening	was	that	the	same	signals	used	for	my	short
trades	became	popular	buy	signals.

**Deciding	whether	a	system	is	in	a	temporary	drawdown	or	has	stopped
working	is	the	primary	dilemma	of	the	system	trader.	How	do	you	deal	with
that?	When	you	made	these	structural	revisions	to	your	system,	such	as
moving	from	entering	trades	on	the	close	to	executing	minute-by-minute
intraday	based	on	volume	projections,	what	triggered	the	decision	to	make
the	change?**

Sometimes	it	was	just	because	I	thought	of	it.	I	would	think	of	an	idea,	test	it,
and	say,	 “Whoa,	that’s	 much	 better,”	and	 then	I	 would	 change	my	 system	 to
trade	it.	Generally,	though,	I’m	much	more	motivated	to	brainstorm	and	test	new
ideas	when	I	am	in	a	drawdown.

**Did	the	ongoing	drawdown	in	2013	trigger	a	similar	search	for	new	ideas?**

It	did.	I	decided	to	search	the	internet	for	new	ideas.	I	found	this	trading	site
called	Stockbee.	I	hung	out	in	that	forum	and	started	sharing	my	trading	history,
as	well	as	opening	up	about	my	recent	problems.	Someone	suggested	I	might
want	to	take	a	look	at	mean	reversion.

**Mean	reversion,	of	course,	is	the	exact	opposite	of	what	you	were	doing.**


Yes,	more	or	less.	I	had	always	assumed	that	mean	reversion	was	the	equivalent
of	catching	a	falling	knife	and	wouldn’t	work.	I	had	never	tested	the	approach.
Digging	deeper,	I	found	books	by	Keith	Fitschen,	Larry	Connors,	and	Howard
Bandy,	 which	 discussed	 mean-reversion	 strategies.	 I	 started	 testing	 some	 of
those	strategies	and	got	excellent	results.

**What	is	the	basic	concept	underlying	the	mean-reversion	system	you	ended
up	using?**

For	 the	 long	 mean-reversion	 system,	 the	 underlying	 requirement	 was	 that	 the
stock	had	to	be	in	an	uptrend	because	you	don’t	want	to	buy	a	stock	that	keeps
going	down	and	down.	Then	the	following	condition	was	that	the	stock	had	to	be
down	a	certain	percentage	from	its	recent	high	within	a	given	time	frame.	If
these	 two	 conditions	 were	 met,	 then	 I	 would	 enter	 a	 buy	 order	 a	 specified
amount	lower,	with	the	exact	amount	lower	based	on	the	stock’s	average	daily
volatility.

**Wouldn’t	the	success	of	the	system	be	very	dependent	on	picking	the	correct
parameter	values?**

No.	Actually,	the	system	is	profitable	for	a	broad	range	of	parameters.	The	more
extreme	the	parameters	you	use	for	entry,	the	fewer	the	trades,	but	the	higher	the
expected	profit	per	trade.	Conversely,	if	you	use	more	moderate	parameters	for
entry,	there	are	a	lot	more	trades,	but	the	expected	win	per	trade	is	marginal.	So
you	try	to	pick	parameter	values	that	are	somewhere	between	these	alternatives.

**How	do	you	exit	your	mean-reversion	trades?**

For	 a	 mean-reversion	 long	 trade,	 you	 enter	 on	 a	 limit	 order	 as	 the	 market	 is
dropping,	and	you	wait	for	a	day	with	a	higher	close	to	exit	the	position.	The
hidden	secret	of	mean-reversion	systems	is	that,	initially,	trades	usually	show
open	losses	as	of	the	close,	and	they	need	to	be	held	overnight	to	be	profitable.
You	are	not	waiting	for	a	big	rebound.	You	are	just	trying	to	capture	a	bunch	of
small	wins.

**What	if	the	trade	goes	against	you?	Do	you	have	a	stop?**

There	is	no	stop.	If	you	use	any	stop—even	a	very	wide	one	like	20%—it	kills
the	results.

**That’s	the	inherent	difficulty	with	mean-reversion	trades.	If	you	are	going
long,	it	implies	that	you	are	taking	the	position	because	the	market	has
fallen	too	much,	too	quickly.	If	you	then	use	a	stop-loss	order,	and	it	is
activated,	by	definition,	you	would	be	getting	out	at	an	even	more	extreme**


**point,	which	would	make	the	rules	somewhat	self-contradictory.**

That’s	right.	The	more	the	rubber	band	is	stretched,	the	higher	the	probability	of
the	trade.	That’s	why	you	can’t	use	a	stop.

**Then	how	do	you	limit	your	risk?	What	if	the	market	keeps	on	dropping
each	day	without	an	intervening	up	day?**

I	use	a	five-day	time	stop.	If	a	higher	close	doesn’t	occur	within	five	days,	I	will
liquidate	the	position.	I	now	also	keep	the	size	of	each	position	small	enough	so
that	even	a	total	loss	would	not	cause	a	10%	account	drawdown,	though	I	didn’t
do	so	at	first.

**Okay,	so	that’s	it.	I	felt	something	was	missing.	I	knew	there	had	to	be	some
other	rule	to	avoid	a	completely	open-ended	loss.	So	either	you	get	your	up
day,	or	you	liquidate	your	position	after	five	days.**

That’s	right.	Also,	I	exclude	biotech	stocks	from	the	universe	of	possible	shorts
because	they	have	the	possibility	of	multiplying	in	price	in	response	to	drug	trial
results	or	FDA	decisions.

**Are	short	mean-reversion	trades	the	mirror	image	of	long	mean-reversion
trades?**

No,	they	are	not.

**What	 is	 the	 primary	 distinction	 between	 long	 and	 short	 mean-reversion
trades,	and	why	did	you	make	that	distinction?**

Many	people	I	know	say,	“I	can’t	find	a	good	short	mean-reversion	system.”
That	is	because	they	are	trying	to	create	a	short	mean-reversion	system	that	is	a
mirror	image	of	a	long	mean-reversion	system.	In	other	words,	they	are	trying	to
design	a	system	that	will	short	a	stock	on	a	rebound	in	a	downtrend.	That	just
doesn’t	work.	My	short	mean-reversion	system	is	only	looking	to	sell	stocks	that
are	in	an	uptrend.

**So	both	your	long	and	short	mean-reversion	trades	are	focused	only	on
stocks	that	are	in	long-term	uptrends.	But	then,	if	a	market	is	already	in	an
uptrend,	how	do	you	define	a	mean-reversion	short	trade?**

Typically,	 these	 signals	 occur	 as	 part	 of	 a	 blow-off	 top	 in	 a	 major	 uptrend
without	any	intervening	correction.	You	are	looking	for	a	particularly	prominent
short-term	upmove—namely,	a	large	percentage	price	rise	in	a	short	period.

**When	did	you	switch	from	the	momentum	systems	you	were	using	to	mean-
reversion	systems?**

Although	the	mean-reversion	strategies	tested	well,	I	was	reluctant	to	make	a


complete	 switch.	 Instead,	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2013,	 I	 decided	 to	 trade	 my	 classic
momentum	strategies,	even	though	they	were	showing	signs	of	failing,	with	half
of	my	account,	and	the	new	long	and	short	mean-reversion	strategies	I	had	just
developed	with	the	other	half.	During	2014,	my	original	systems	were	about	flat,
while	the	new	mean-reversion	systems	were	up	about	40%.	My	overall	account,
though,	was	up	only	20%	because	I	was	trading	the	new	systems	with	only	half
of	my	account.	I	felt	angry	that	my	cautious	approach	to	phasing	in	the	new
systems	had	caused	me	to	leave	those	extra	profits	on	the	table.

At	the	end	of	2014,	I	decided	my	classic	systems	had	lost	their	edge	and	that	I
would	trade	only	the	new	mean-reversion	systems	going	forward	into	2015.	And
I	was	determined	not	to	miss	out	this	time,	so	I	foolishly	decided	to	allocate
120%	of	capital	to	them.	The	new	systems	did	very	well	for	the	first	four	months
of	the	year,	gaining	over	25%.	My	cumulative	profits	even	hit	a	new	high	in	May

2015.	However,	the	rest	of	the	year	was	a	disaster.	That	is	when	I	discovered	the
tail	risk	inherent	in	mean	reversion.	First,	there	was	a	hit	on	the	short	side	when	I
was	shorting	Chinese	ADRs,	and	they	just	kept	on	going	up.	Then	I	took	another
hit	after	Hillary	Clinton	came	out	with	a	tweet	about	regulating	drug	prices,	and
the	biotech	sector	fell	apart.	My	mean-reversion	system	kept	on	buying	these
stocks,	and	they	kept	on	going	down.	I	not	only	gave	back	all	my	profits	from
earlier	in	the	year,	but	I	also	finished	2015	with	a	net	loss	of	about	10%.	It	was
the	worst	drawdown	of	my	entire	trading	career.

I	didn’t	fully	appreciate	the	extent	to	which	losing	trades	can	cluster	together	in
time.	It	was	the	“eats	like	a	bird,	shits	like	an	elephant”	phenomenon.	I	knew
about	this	possibility,	and	I	had	modeled	my	systems	to	account	for	it.	I	had
analyzed	in	great	detail	how	my	systems	would	have	done	during	every	prior
market	correction	since	the	1980s.	However,	what	emerged	in	2015	that	had	not
occurred	 in	 the	 prior	 data	 were	 sudden,	 large	 price	 moves	 in	 specific	 market
segments	(first	China,	then	biotech)	that	subsequently	persisted	for	longer	than	I
had	seen	before.

To	 make	 matters	 worse,	 during	 this	 entire	 drawdown,	 I	 turned	 off	 my	 usual
position	 size	 recalculation	 based	 on	 the	 daily	 account	 value	 and	 instead	 kept
using	the	peak	value.	I	had	observed	that	mean-reversion	systems	often	bounced
back	quickly	from	drawdowns,	and	I	figured	the	system	would	recover	faster
with	larger	positions.

I	had	not	yet	discovered	that,	in	contrast	to	my	classic	long	and	short	momentum
strategies,	 long	 and	 short	 mean-reversion	 systems	 don’t	 naturally	 hedge	 each


other.	In	mean-reversion	systems,	when	the	market	is	tanking,	you	don’t	get	sell
signals.	 So,	 you	 need	 to	 hedge	 a	 long	 mean-reversion	 system	 with	 a	 short
momentum	system.

At	the	end	of	2015,	I	decided	to	put	my	original	classic	systems	back	into	the
mix.	Almost	immediately	after	making	this	change,	I	took	a	10%	loss	in	the	first
two	weeks	of	2016	when	both	long	strategies	tanked	and	neither	short	strategy
compensated.	I	was	now	down	45%	from	the	peak.	At	that	point,	it	was	all	I
could	take,	and	I	stopped	trading.	I	had	no	confidence	left.	I	just	thought,	“I	can’t
do	this	anymore.”

**How	did	you	regain	your	confidence?**

I	think	it	was	just	a	matter	of	time	passing.	After	a	couple	of	months,	I	thought,
“I	can’t	quit.	I	have	invested	a	lot	into	this.	I	know	what	I’m	doing.”	I	came	up
with	a	different,	somewhat	more	conservative	approach,	and	I	have	done	pretty
well	since	then.

It	was	also	the	first	time	I	ever	wrote	a	trading	plan.	I	did	it	mainly	for	my	wife
to	 convince	 her	 that	 it	 was	 a	 good	 idea	 to	 resume	 trading	 rather	 than	 to	 do
something	else.

**What	was	in	the	trading	plan?**

The	most	important	rule	was	the	inclusion	of	a	system	stop.	Specifically,	if	I	lost
10%	from	my	starting	level	or	15%	from	an	equity	high	after	I	was	ahead	at	least
5%,	I	would	stop	trading.

**Was	that	the	first	time	you	used	a	system	stop?**

No,	I	always	had	a	20%	system	stop.	I	hit	those	stops	in	2001	and	2005,	and	I
stopped	trading	both	times.

**How	long	were	these	hiatuses?**

Until	I	did	more	backtesting,	made	some	tweaks,	and	felt	I	was	ready	to	start
trading	again.

**Are	we	talking	about	days,	weeks,	or	months?**

In	2001,	it	was	a	couple	of	weeks.	In	2005,	it	was	a	month	or	two.	The	more
extended	trading	break	in	2005	was	mostly	a	consequence	of	my	concluding	that
I	needed	to	switch	to	a	system	of	scanning	for	signals	every	minute	during	the
day—a	change	that	required	time	for	new	software	development.

**So	a	system	stop	was	not	something	new.	It	was	just	that	you	were	risking
half	the	equity	drawdown	as	before.**

That’s	right.


**When	you	resumed	trading	in	March	2016,	were	you	using	only	the	long
and	short	mean-reversion	systems?**

Initially,	I	was.

**So	adding	back	your	classical	systems	only	lasted	for	a	few	months?**

It	only	lasted	for	a	few	weeks.

**Since	you	were	trading	only	the	mean-reversion	systems,	what	prevented
the	same	type	of	drawdown	you	had	experienced	in	2015	when	you	were
using	only	those	systems?**

I	made	several	changes.	I	eliminated	allowing	the	total	position	value	to	ever
exceed	100%,	even	if	it	was	only	temporarily	intraday.	I	switched	from	fixed-
shares	 to	 fixed-percent-of-equity	 position	 sizing.	 Finally,	 I	 eliminated	 biotech
stocks	 from	 both	 sides,	 after	 seeing	 how	 prone	 they	 were	 to	 extreme	 price
moves.

**What	was	the	next	significant	change	you	made,	and	why?**

I	traded	only	my	mean-reversion	systems	from	March	2016	through	December

2017.	Although	they	did	well	during	that	period,	ever	since	I	had	deactivated	my
classic	momentum	systems,	I	was	looking	for	something	to	replace	them.	I	like
the	 idea	 of	 having	 a	 quad-system	 approach	 where	 you	 have	 long	 and	 short
versions	 of	 both	 momentum	 and	 mean-reversion	 systems.	 If	 you	 are	 trading
multiple	 systems	 that	 are	 well	 differentiated	 and	 diversify	 each	 other,	 the
combination	can	be	superior	to	the	best	individual	system.

I	noticed	that	a	lot	of	the	people	on	Stockbee	focused	on	trading	IPOs.	That	gave
me	 the	 idea	 of	 limiting	 the	 trading	 universe	 to	 recent	 IPOs	 in	 backtesting
momentum	 systems.	 I	 discovered	 that	 IPOs	 have	 some	 unique	 properties.	 I
found	 that	 a	 very	 simple	 trend-following	 system	 based	 on	 buying	 new	 highs
worked	very	well	on	recent	IPOs,	even	though	it	didn’t	work	at	all	on	the	general
universe	of	stocks.

**Was	there	also	a	short	version	of	the	IPO	momentum	system?**

There	was,	but	it	didn’t	trade	too	often,	and	it	didn’t	have	much	net	impact.	Also,
this	year	[2019],	I	added	a	short	momentum	strategy	that	uses	a	mean-reversion
entry.

**So,	are	you	now	trading	five	systems?**

I	was	for	a	while,	but	a	few	months	ago,	I	deactivated	the	long	mean-reversion
system	because	of	a	risk-control	rule	I	had	added.	I	now	will	turn	off	a	system	if
its	equity	curve	goes	below	its	200-day	moving	average,	which	is	what	happened


to	the	long	mean-reversion	system.	It	was	the	first	time	I	used	the	concept	of
trading	 a	 system’s	 equity	 curve	 as	 a	 signal	 to	 shut	 it	 off.	 The	 long	 mean-
reversion	system	is	currently	in	a	32%	drawdown,	but	I	only	have	a	small	loss	in
it	this	year	because	I	am	not	trading	it	now.

**When	would	you	turn	the	system	back	on?**

In	some	cases,	I	might	reactivate	a	system	if	its	equity	curve	went	back	above
the	 200-day	 moving	 average.	 However,	 the	 length	 and	 depth	 of	 the	 current
drawdown	make	this	system	no	longer	attractive	to	ever	trade	again.

**So	you	apply	this	approach	for	deactivating	systems	separately	to	each	of
your	short	and	long	strategies	and	only	trade	those	systems	that	are	on	the
right	side	of	the	200-day	moving	average.**

Right.

**Doesn’t	that	imply	that	you	may	sometimes	find	yourself	trading	only	long
or	only	short	strategies?**

Since	 I	 only	 recently	 started	 monitoring	 the	 system	 equity	 curves	 for
deactivation	signals,	this	year’s	long	mean-reversion	system	decline	below	its
200-day	moving	average	was	the	only	time	such	an	event	has	occurred.	After
concluding	that	this	system	was	no	longer	usable,	I	recently	spent	several	days
brainstorming	and	testing	other	ways	to	structure	a	long	mean-reversion	strategy.
I	found	and	activated	what	I	believe	will	be	an	effective	replacement.	Frankly,	I
am	more	likely	to	do	new	research	than	to	reactivate	a	system	that	has	stopped
itself	out.

**What	is	your	take	on	optimization?	[** **_Optimization_** **	refers	to	the	process	of
finding	the	best-performing	parameters	for	a	given	system.	The	underlying
premise	of	optimization	is	that	the	parameters	that	worked	best	in	the	past
have	 a	 higher	 probability	 of	 superior	 performance	 in	 the	 future.	 The
validity	of	this	premise,	however,	is	open	to	question.]**

You	have	to	find	the	balance	between	looking	for	something	that	works	better,
while,	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 avoiding	 over-optimization.	 Early	 on,	 I	 didn’t
understand	any	of	this.	I	would	add	any	parameters	I	wanted,	test	over	any	range
of	values,	even	down	to	using	decimal	points,	and	then	choose	the	parameter
values	that	had	the	best	past	performance.	I	knew	that	was	probably	the	wrong
thing	to	do,	but	I	didn’t	know	what	else	to	do.	Eventually,	I	realized	that	frequent
optimization	doesn’t	help	returns	and	that	chasing	the	best	recent	parameters	is
an	illusion.

**What	do	you	do	differently	now?**


I	have	a	bias	in	building	a	strategy	to	make	it	as	simple	as	possible,	using	as	few
rules	 as	 possible,	 testing	 only	 a	 few	 parameter	 values	 that	 seem	 to	 be	 in	 a
reasonable	range.	For	example,	if	one	of	my	parameters	was	the	profit	target,	I
might	test	values	between	6%	and	12%	at	1%	intervals.	What	I	like	is	when	the
results	don’t	differ	too	much	between	different	parameter	values	because	that
means	the	system	is	robust.	What’s	even	better	is	when	I	can	altogether	remove	a
parameterized	rule	from	a	system.	When	I	develop	a	new	strategy	now,	I	may
not	even	run	my	optimization	program.

**What	do	you	know	now	that	you	wish	you	knew	when	you	started?**

That’s	funny;	I	don’t	think	I	know	that	much	even	now.	I	feel	in	many	ways,	I
am	as	clueless	as	I	ever	was	[he	laughs].	In	one	sense,	my	answer	is	“nothing”
because	if	I	knew	everything	I	do	now,	I	might	never	have	tried	trading	in	the
first	place.	As	my	mother,	who	grew	up	very	poor,	didn’t	go	to	college	and	still
had	a	very	successful	business	career	likes	to	say:	“I	succeeded	because	I	didn’t
know	that	I	couldn’t.”

Given	that	qualification,	here	are	some	insights	that	would	have	been	helpful	to
know	earlier	on:

```
1 .	It’s	more	effective	to	build	a	diverse	collection	of	simple	systems	than	to
keep	adding	rules	and	re-optimizing	a	single	system.
2 .	It’s	wise	to	include	an	on/off	switch	(e.g.,	an	equity	curve	moving	below	its
moving	average)	in	each	strategy,	 even	if	it	reduces	profits	in	a	backtest.
This	rule	can	significantly	limit	losses	if	a	system	stops	working,	as	can	and
will	happen.	The	more	strategies	you	run,	the	easier	it	is	emotionally	to	turn
one	off.	In	this	sense,	this	rule	reinforces	the	importance	of	rule	#1.
3 .	The	tail-risk	in	a	mean-reversion	strategy	is	more	likely	to	come	from	a
cluster	of	medium-sized	losing	trades	rather	than	from	the	potential	for	a
huge	loss	in	an	individual	trade.	Allow	for	the	possibility	that	the	serial
correlation	of	losses	is	probably	understated	in	any	backtest.
4 .	It	is	possible	to	succeed	quickly,	continue	to	do	well	for	15	years,	and	then
have	a	near-career-ending	drawdown.	Therefore,	it	is	advisable	to	maintain
another	income	source,	if	possible.
5 .	Good	things	come	from	sharing	your	story	and	knowledge	with	others—
something	I	was	afraid	to	do	for	many	years.
```

**What	advice	would	you	give	to	someone	who	wanted	to	be	a	trader?**

Don’t	 quit	 your	 day	 job.	 Try	 to	 develop	 an	 appreciation	 for	 how	 much
randomness	 there	 is	 in	 the	 market.	 Test	 everything.	 Don’t	 assume	 something
works	or	doesn’t	work	just	because	someone	says	so.	Maintain	an	ever-present
spirit	of	experimentation.

Perhaps	the	most	critical	factor	in	Parker’s	long-term	success	is	his	willingness
to	substantively	change	or	even	entirely	abandon	systems	when	it	appears	they
may	have	lost	their	efficacy.	He	made	such	major	course	shifts	multiple	times	in
his	career,	skirting	disaster	in	the	process.	It	is	striking	that	some	of	the	systems
that	 Parker	 traded	 profitably	 for	 many	 years	 stopped	 working,	 and	 never
recovered.	 If	 Parker	 didn’t	 have	 the	 flexibility	 to	 radically	 alter	 his	 trading
approach—even	 to	 the	 extent	 of	 switching	 from	 momentum	 systems	 to	 their
exact	 opposite:	 mean-reversion	 systems—he	 would	 never	 have	 survived,	 let
alone	prospered	as	a	trader.

A	frequent	recommendation	given	to	systematic	traders	is	to	follow	the	rules	of
the	system	unwaveringly.	This	advice	is	sound	for	a	system	with	a	definitive
edge	and	effective	risk	controls.	In	such	cases,	second-guessing	system	signals
will	frequently	have	a	deleterious	impact.	It	is	in	this	context	that	Ed	Seykota’s
first	maxim	cited	at	the	start	of	this	chapter—follow	the	rules	without	question—
is	intended	to	apply.	And,	indeed,	Parker	followed	this	prescription	in	designing
a	trading	process	that	was	100%	mechanical.

The	problem,	however,	is	that	systems	can	work	for	a	time	but	then	entirely	lose
their	 edge,	 or	 even	 become	 consistent	 net	 losers.	 This	 uncomfortable	 reality
implies	that	the	ability	to	terminate	or	radically	change	systems	is	an	essential
ingredient	to	longer-term	success	as	a	systematic	trader.	It	is	this	observation	that
Seykota’s	second	assertion—know	when	to	break	the	rules—is	meant	to	address.
Again,	 Parker	 adhered	 to	 this	 principle	 by	 changing	 his	 systems,	 sometimes
radically,	multiple	times—actions	that	proved	critical	to	his	longer-term	success.

One	of	the	toughest	dilemmas	that	face	systematic	traders	is	deciding	whether	an
ongoing	losing	period	for	a	system	represents	a	temporary	phase	that	will	be
followed	by	a	recovery	to	new	equity	highs,	or	whether	the	system	no	longer
works.	 There	 is	 no	 simple	 prescription	 for	 how	 to	 decide	 between	 these	 two
opposite	 interpretations.	 However,	 the	 lesson	 systematic	 traders	 should	 draw


from	this	chapter	is	that	sometimes	abandoning	a	system	is	the	right	decision.	It
is	one	of	those	rare	instances	where	discipline	in	trading—in	this	case,	following
the	system	absolutely—may	not	be	a	good	thing.

The	trading	strategy	revisions	that	Parker	made	that	were	critical	to	sustaining
profitability	 were	 all	 substantive.	 Examples	 include	 changing	 from	 entering
orders	on	the	close	to	entering	intraday,	switching	from	momentum	to	mean-
reversion	 systems,	 and	 developing	 new	 systems	 that	 worked	 on	 IPOs,	 even
though	 they	 didn’t	 work	 more	 broadly.	 These	 types	 of	 structural	 changes	 are
quite	different	from	alterations	such	as	changing	parameter	values,	which	are
more	cosmetic	adjustments.	Although	Parker	frequently	changed	the	parameter
values	in	his	systems	so	that	a	recent	drawdown	would	have	been	mitigated	or
eliminated	if	the	revised	parameter	values	had	been	used,	he	now	recognizes	that
these	changes	made	little	difference	in	future	profitability.	Continually	revising
parameters	 to	 maximize	 past	 results	 (a	 process	 called	 _optimization_ )	 can	 even
have	detrimental	ramifications.

Traders	who	develop	trading	systems	should	be	wary	of	the	pitfalls	inherent	in
optimization.	 The	 danger	 is	 not	 that	 optimization	 is	 likely	 to	 lead	 to	 worse
trading	 results	 (although	 it	 may),	 but	 rather	 that	 it	 will	 give	 traders	 highly
distorted	expectations	regarding	the	efficacy	of	the	systems	they	test.	In	a	worst-
case,	the	overstated	results	that	are	implicit	in	optimization	could	lead	system
developers	 to	 select	 and	 trade	 a	 system	 that	 hindsight-free	 testing	 procedures
would	have	revealed	to	have	a	negative	expected	return.	Another	danger	is	that
over-optimization	(fine-tuning	a	system	to	maximize	past	performance)	can	lead
to	designing	systems	that	are	too	curve-fitted	to	the	past	to	work	well	in	the
future.

Parker	 initially	 was	 oblivious	 of	 these	 pitfalls.	 With	 experience,	 he	 became
aware	of	the	distortions	inherent	in	optimized	results	and	the	drawbacks	of	over-
optimization.	 Regarding	 the	 deviation	 between	 optimized	 and	 actual	 results,
Parker	said,	“Throughout	my	career,	the	systems	I’ve	used	have	generally	shown
annual	returns	of	50%–100%	with	maximum	drawdowns	of	less	than	10%	in
backtesting.	Then	in	actual	application,	I	get	returns	closer	to	about	20%,	and
that	is	what	I	expect.”	Parker	now	also	severely	limits	the	degree	of	optimization
he	uses,	and,	sometimes,	he	may	not	even	run	his	optimization	program	when
designing	a	new	strategy.

Based	 on	 multiple	 empirical	 tests	 I	 have	 conducted	 in	 the	 past,	 my	 own	 key
conclusions	about	optimization,	which	I	believe	are	also	consistent	with	Parker’s


views,	can	be	summarized	as	follows:^20

```
1 .	Any	 system—repeat,	 any	 system—can	 be	 made	 to	 be	 very	 profitable
through	optimization	(that	is	in	regards	to	past	performance).	If	you	ever
find	 a	 system	 that	 can’t	 be	 optimized	 to	 show	 good	 profits	 in	 the	 past,
congratulations,	you	have	just	discovered	a	money	machine	(by	doing	the
opposite,	unless	transaction	costs	are	excessive).	Therefore,	incredible	past
performance	for	a	system	that	has	been	optimized	may	be	nice	to	look	at,
but	it	doesn’t	mean	very	much.
2 .	Optimization	 will	 always,	 repeat	 always,	 overstate	 the	 potential	 future
performance	 of	 a	 system—usually	 by	 a	 wide	 margin	 (say,	 three	 trailer
trucks’	worth).	Therefore,	optimized	results	should	never,	repeat	never,	be
used	to	evaluate	a	system’s	merit.
3 .	For	 many,	 if	 not	 most	 systems,	 optimization	 will	 improve	 future
performance	only	marginally,	if	at	all.
4 .	If	optimization	has	any	value,	it	is	usually	in	defining	the	broad	boundaries
for	the	ranges	from	which	parameter	values	in	the	system	should	be	chosen.
Fine-tuning	 optimization	 is,	 at	 best,	 a	 waste	 of	 time	 and,	 at	 worst,	 self-
delusion.
5 .	Given	 the	 above	 considerations,	 sophisticated	 and	 complex	 optimization
procedures	are	a	waste	of	time.	The	simplest	optimization	procedure	will
provide	as	much	meaningful	information	(assuming	that	there	is	any	useful
information	to	be	derived).
```
In	summary,	contrary	to	widespread	belief,	there	is	some	reasonable	question	as
to	whether	optimization	will	yield	meaningfully	better	results	over	the	long	run
than	randomly	picking	the	parameter	values	to	be	traded	from	reasonable	value
ranges.	Lest	there	be	any	confusion,	let	me	explicitly	state	that	this	statement	is
not	intended	to	imply	that	optimization	is	never	of	any	value.	Optimization	can
be	 useful	 in	 defining	 the	 suboptimal	 extreme	 ranges	 that	 should	 be	 excluded
from	 the	 selection	 of	 parameter	 values.	 Also,	 for	 some	 systems,	 optimization
may	provide	some	edge	in	parameter	selection,	even	after	suboptimal	extreme
ranges	 are	 excluded.	 However,	 I	 do	 mean	 to	 imply	 that	 the	 degree	 of
improvement	 offered	 by	 optimization	 is	 far	 less	 than	 generally	 perceived.
Traders	 would	 probably	 save	 considerable	 money	 by	 first	 proving	 any
assumptions	 they	 are	 making	 about	 optimization	 rather	 than	 taking	 such


assumptions	on	blind	faith.

Risk	management	is	as	much	an	essential	ingredient	for	success	for	systematic
traders	as	it	is	for	discretionary	traders.	Over	the	years,	Parker	adopted	multiple
risk	control	rules	as	part	of	his	process.	These	rules	include:

```
1 .	 Trading	Stop —Parker	will	stop	trading	if	his	account	equity	declines	by	a
specified	 percentage.	 Initially,	 Parker	 used	 a	 20%	 equity	 drawdown	 as	 a
trigger	 to	 stop	 trading.	 In	 2016,	 after	 contemplating	 quitting	 trading,	 he
resumed	trading	but	reduced	this	stop	point	to	10%	(increasing	this	cut-out
point	to	15%	once	the	account	was	ahead	by	5%).	A	trading	stop	is	a	very
effective	 risk	 management	 tool.	 It	 allows	 traders	 to	 determine	 the
approximate	 maximum	 amount	 they	 can	 lose	 (assuming	 they	 have	 the
discipline	 to	 adhere	 to	 their	 own	 rule).	 Traders	 can	 thereby	 define	 their
worst-case	 outcome	 at	 the	 outset.	 By	 keeping	 this	 trading	 cessation	 loss
point	 small,	 traders	 can	 restrict	 losses	 to	 levels	 within	 their	 financial
comfort	zone.
An	 account-equity-based	 stop	 point	 can	 also	 allow	 traders	 multiple
opportunities	to	succeed.	Too	many	traders	do	not	employ	any	account
risk	constraint,	making	them	vulnerable	to	being	knocked	out	of	the
game	permanently	by	one	large	loss.	Always	keep	your	account	risk
small	 enough	 so	 that	 you	 have	 the	 opportunity	 to	 come	 back	 for
another	 try	 with	 a	 clean	 slate	 if	 your	 initial	 trading	 foray	 is
unsuccessful.	The	kitty	in	poker	provides	a	useful	analogy.	If	you	have
been	 dealt	 a	 lousy	 hand,	 you	 want	 to	 limit	 your	 loss	 to	 the	 kitty
contribution	rather	than	going	all-in.	You	want	to	assure	that	you	have
the	opportunity	to	try	again	with	another	hand.
2 .	 System	Stop —Parker	will	use	trend-following	applied	to	a	system’s	equity
curve	to	signal	when	a	system	should	be	deactivated.	Specifically,	Parker
will	stop	trading	a	system	if	its	equity	curve	falls	below	its	200-day	moving
average	and	wait	to	resume	trading	the	system	until	its	equity	curve	rises
back	above	the	200-day	moving	average.	There	is	nothing	magical	about
the	specific	trend-following	signal	Parker	uses.	The	critical	concept	is	the
idea	 of	 applying	 technical	 analysis	 to	 the	 equity	 curve	 as	 a	 risk-control
method.	This	risk	control	strategy	is	not	just	applicable	to	systems	but	can
also	 be	 implemented	 at	 the	 portfolio	 level	 for	 both	 systematic	 and
discretionary	traders.
```

```
Whether	 trading	 the	 equity	 curve of	 a	 system	 or	 portfolio	 is	 net
beneficial	 will	 depend	 on	 the	 specific	 system	 or	 methodology
employed.	But	traders	should	at	least	explore	whether	this	approach
would	 be	 net	 beneficial	 to	 them.	 Even	 in	 those	 instances	 where
deactivating	 and	 activating	 a	 system	 (or	 portfolio)	 based	 on	 trend
signals	 reduces	 total	 return,	 it	 can	 still	 reduce	 risk	 (e.g.,	 mitigate
drawdowns).	The	key	consideration	should	be	whether	the	approach
increases	return/risk.	If	it	does,	any	reduction	in	return	can	be	offset	by
increasing	trade	size,	while	still	providing	lower	risk.	Traders	can	find
tools	for	applying	technical	analysis	to	their	equity	curves	by	linking
or	uploading	their	account	data	at	FundSeeder.com.	(Full	disclosure:	I
have	a	financial	interest	in	FundSeeder.)
3 .	 Position	Sizing	Adjustments —In	2015,	Parker	learned	the	hard	way	of	the
dangers	 of	 increasing	 position	 size	 to	 make	 up	 for	 a	 prior	 missed
opportunity.	Trading	size	needs	to	be	based	on	daily	net	account	value	and
calculated	 using	 a	 consistent	 formula.	 Otherwise,	 while	 you	 might
occasionally	 get	 lucky	 with	 an	 oversized	 win,	 you	 risk	 amplifying	 a
cumulative	drawdown.
```
Trading	for	a	living	is	hard.	Parker	almost	quit	trading	in	early	2016,	only	eight
months	after	having	set	new	highs	in	cumulative	profits	and	despite	still	being
more	than	$5	million	ahead.	If	you	are	trading	for	a	living,	it	is	not	enough	for
your	 cumulative	 profits	 to	 continue	 rising.	 They	 have	 to	 continually	 keep
climbing	by	more	than	the	sum	of	taxes	and	cumulative	withdrawals	for	living
expenses.	Parker’s	visceral	experience	with	the	difficulty	of	this	task	leads	him
to	advise	aspirants	seeking	to	trade	for	a	living	to	keep	their	day	job	as	long	as
feasible.

17 	I	excluded	the	first	two	years	of	Parker’s	track	record	in	the	return	and	return/risk	calculations	because
this	period	included	discretionary	trading,	which	is	not	representative	of	the	systematic	methodology	he
adopted	and	used	for	the	rest	of	his	trading	career.	In	addition,	this	period	also	included	trades	in	which	he
followed	the	trades	of	another	trader.	The	return	and	return/risk	statistics	would	have	been	even	better	if
these	two	years	had	been	included.

# Michael	Kean: 	Complementary	Strategies

# MICHAEL	Kean	started	investing	in	stocks	as	a	hobby	when	he	was	a	university

student	in	New	Zealand.	After	four	years	of	working	at	financial	service	firms	in
jobs	unrelated	to	investing	or	trading,	he	left	New	Zealand	for	London,	hoping
he	 would	 find	 a	 position	 closer	 to	 his	 interests	 in	 one	 of	 the	 world’s	 leading
financial	 centers.	 Kean	 never	 did	 get	 that	 market-related	 job.	 Undeterred,
however,	two	years	after	arriving	in	London,	he	launched	his	asset	management
company,	Steel	Road	Capital,	managing	a	few	small	accounts	for	friends	and
family,	as	a	side	project	to	his	day	job.	He	eventually	gave	up	the	day	job	to
focus	full-time	on	portfolio	management.	Kean	still	operates	as	a	one-man	shop.
Although	he	has	outperformed	the	vast	majority	of	hedge	funds,	Kean’s	assets
under	management	remain	quite	small	($8	million),	and	he	does	not	have	any
aspirations	to	manage	large	sums.

Over	the	years,	Kean	developed	a	unique	management	approach	that	combines
long	equity	investment	with	short-term	event	trading,	primarily	on	the	short	side
of	biotech	stocks.	In	his	short	positions,	Kean	focuses	on	situations	where	less
sophisticated	buyers	are	more	likely	to	be	on	the	other	side	of	the	trade.	These
trades	typically	involve	small-cap	stocks	witnessing	fundamentally	unwarranted
rallies	in	response	to	news	or	an	impending	catalyst	event.

The	inverse	correlation	between	the	investment	and	trading	components	of	his
portfolio	 has	 allowed	 Kean	 to	 generate	 returns	 substantially	 outpacing	 equity
indexes,	while	at	the	same	time	keeping	his	maximum	drawdown	under	20%.	In
the	ten	years	since	starting	his	management	company,	Kean	has	achieved	a	29%
average	annual	compounded	return	(before	management	fees),	nearly	triple	the
11%	S&P	500	return	during	the	same	period.	His	monthly	Gain	to	Pain	ratio	(see
Appendix	2	for	definition)	is	also	nearly	triple	the	corresponding	S&P	figure:
2.86	versus	0.96.

Although	 living	 in	 London	 for	 a	 decade,	 Kean	 has	 retained	 a	 strong	 New
Zealand	accent,	which,	at	times,	left	me	befuddled	as	to	what	he	had	just	said,
forcing	me	to	ask	him	to	repeat	himself.	Sample:	When	he	was	talking	about	the
advantages	of	using	a	managed	account	structure	over	a	fund	structure,	I	heard,
“it	saved	me	a	lot	of	Edmund.”	“A	lot	of	what?”	I	asked	in	confusion.	It	turned
out	he	had	said,	“admin.”	At	another	point,	when	talking	about	a	drug	trial	for	a
treatment	for	age-related	macular	degeneration	(AMD),	Kean	kept	referring	to
what	 sounded	 like	 “riskier	 injections,”	 a	 phrase	 that	 made	 no	 sense	 to	 me.


Finally,	I	had	to	stop	him.	“What	do	you	mean	by	riskier	injections?”	I	asked.
After	he	repeated	the	phrase	a	couple	of	times,	I	realized,	he	had	been	saying
“rescue	injections.”	One	more:	During	the	interview,	Kean	kept	using	the	term
“closing	grain”	in	talking	about	a	stock’s	price	movement.	It	seemed	clear	from
the	context	that	he	was	referring	to	a	stock	closing	higher,	and	since	I	didn’t
want	to	interrupt	him	yet	again	to	ask	him	what	word	he	was	saying,	I	let	it	go.	It
was	only	when	I	was	listening	to	the	interview	recordings	in	writing	this	chapter
that	it	finally	dawned	on	me	that	he	had	been	saying,	“closing	green.”	Kean	took
my	 difficulty	 with	 his	 accent	 in	 good	 humor,	 laughing	 at	 some	 of	 the
misunderstandings.	After	our	meeting,	he	sent	an	email,	“If	you	have	any	issues
deciphering	my	New	Zealand	accent,	don’t	hesitate	to	reach	out!”

Daljit	Dhaliwal,	a	phenomenal	trader	(see	Chapter	5)	and	an	investor	with	Kean,
offered	 this	 comment,	 “Michael	 is	 unique	 because	 he	 combines	 two	 very
different	approaches:	long	equities	on	one	side	and	a	unique	short	strategy	on	the
other.	 His	 ability	 to	 do	 both	 shows	 how	 adaptable	 he	 is	 as	 a	 person,	 and
adaptability	is	critical	in	the	game	of	speculation.”

**As	a	native	New	Zealander,	where	did	you	get	your	interest	in	markets?	I
assume	it’s	probably	not	a	big	thing	in	New	Zealand.**

Well,	it’s	funny	you	should	say	that.	Actually,	the	New	Zealand	stock	market
was	a	big	thing	in	the	1980s,	and	then	it	was	very	quiet	for	a	long	time.	The	story
I	heard	from	my	mom	and	dad	when	I	was	growing	up	is	that	they	were	able	to
afford	the	deposit	on	the	farm	they	now	own	because	of	a	stock	market	windfall.
During	the	1980s,	there	was	a	massive	stock	market	boom	in	New	Zealand.	The
catalyst	for	the	bull	market	was	that	New	Zealand	transitioned	from	one	of	the
most	closed	economies	in	the	world	to	one	of	the	most	open	in	a	few	years.
Tariffs,	subsidies,	and	taxes	were	all	substantially	reduced.

**I	assume	that	was	due	to	a	change	in	government?**

Yes,	the	Labour	Party	came	in	and	shook	things	up.

**Wouldn’t	the	Labour	Party	be	left	of	center?**

They	were.

**And	they	pushed	for	opening	the	economy?**

Funny,	isn’t	it?

**Well,	 I	 guess	 we	 have	 the	 exact	 opposite	 oddity	 in	 the	 US	 now,	 with**


**Republicans	supporting	Trump’s	trade	wars	and	massive	deficits.**

There	was	also	a	great	deal	of	financial	deregulation.	As	a	result	of	all	of	these
policy	changes,	a	lot	of	money	found	its	way	into	the	New	Zealand	stock	market.

**Was	it	external	or	internal	money?**

I	assume	it	was	both,	but	it	was	a	classic	retail-driven	boom.	Everyone	was	in	on
it,	and	mom	and	dad	were	just	like	everyone	else.	They	put	all	their	savings	into
the	 stock	 market.	 They	 sold	 all	 their	 stock	 holdings	 in	 early	 1987	 to	 buy
farmland,	 something	 they	 always	 wanted	 to	 do.	 They	 sold	 their	 stock	 then
because	they	had	bought	their	house	with	the	assistance	of	a	government	subsidy
that	required	they	hold	the	property	for	five	years.	As	soon	as	the	five	years	were
up,	they	were	free	to	sell	their	home	and	buy	a	farm.	They	were	very	lucky.	If
the	requirement	had	been	six	years	instead	of	five,	the	story	would	have	ended
very	differently.	Your	Black	Monday	was	our	Black	Tuesday.	The	1987	crash	in
the	US	was	the	event	that	popped	the	New	Zealand	stock	market	bubble.	Within
six	months,	the	stock	market	was	down	50%.	It	didn’t	recover	to	the	old	highs
for	over	20	years.

**What	percent	profits	did	your	parents	make	on	their	investment?**

I	don’t	know,	but	the	New	Zealand	market	went	up	sixfold,	and	they	sold	within
a	half-year	of	the	high.	So,	I	would	guess	they	at	least	tripled	their	money.

**So,	the	fact	that	your	parents	made	enough	money	in	the	stock	market	to
buy	a	farm,	albeit	by	luck,	registered	with	you.	How	old	were	you	at	the
time	they	sold	their	stock	and	bought	the	farm?**

I	was	only	about	five	years	old.	But	it	was	a	story	that	was	passed	on	as	I	was
growing	up,	and	that	story	stuck	with	me.	My	dad	has	a	different	perspective	on
his	stock	market	windfall.	He	insists	it	was	pure	skill.

**How	did	your	interest	in	markets	and	trading	develop	beyond	the	family
story?**

My	interest	in	markets	developed	when	I	was	attending	university.	I	had	a	group
of	friends	who	were	always	talking	about	the	stock	market.	There	were	eight	of
us,	and	we	ended	up	setting	up	an	investment	club.	We	each	chipped	in	a	grand
for	a	pooled	investment	account.	Initially,	it	was	like	a	typical	share	club	where
we	had	meetings,	and	everybody	had	some	input.	But,	eventually,	only	two	of
us,	 myself	 and	 one	 of	 the	 other	 members,	 ended	 up	 doing	 all	 the	 work,	 and
everyone	else	just	went	along	with	our	stock	selections.	After	we	graduated,	my
friend	got	an	investment	banking	job,	and	he	had	to	stop	participating.	So	from
2004	on,	I	managed	the	portfolio	on	my	own.	The	share	club	continued	through


### 2010.

**How	was	the	performance?**

Until	2008,	it	was	average	at	best.	Then	in	2008,	we	lost	50%	in	six	months.
However,	I	realized	that	stocks	were	insanely	cheap.	I	convinced	some	of	the
investors	to	double	down,	and	the	portfolio	was	up	88%	in	2009.

**Why	did	the	share	club	end	in	2010?**

I	wanted	to	convert	it	from	a	share	club	constitution	into	a	formal	investment
structure.	 I	 used	 the	 strong	 2009	 performance	 to	 convince	 some	 of	 the	 club
investors	to	invest	with	me	in	a	managed	account	structure.

**How	much	time	were	you	devoting	to	the	investment	side?**

I	spent	as	much	time	as	I	could.	I	was	working	in	London	at	the	time,	and	I	was
fortunate	to	have	a	job	with	a	very	flexible	work-at-home	policy.	I	would	get	up
very	early	every	day	to	do	my	salaried	work	in	the	morning,	and	then	I	would
trade	the	US	markets	in	the	afternoon.	It	was	a	unique	situation	that	allowed	me
to	almost	be	a	full-time	trader	and	still	pay	the	rent.

**Why	did	you	leave	New	Zealand	for	London?**

It’s	common	for	New	Zealanders	in	their	20s	to	head	over	to	London	for	a	few
years.

**Did	you	move	to	London	intending	to	find	a	market-related	job?**

Yes,	 London	 is	 a	 world	 financial	 center,	 so	 I	 thought	 it	 would	 be	 a	 good
opportunity	to	work	for	a	bank	or	a	fund	manager—something	more	in	line	with
my	interests.

**Did	you	have	any	trouble	finding	a	job	in	London?**

I	landed	in	London	in	September	2008!	[He	laughs	as	he	says	this	because	his
arrival	coincided	with	the	financial	meltdown.]	I	still	remember	exiting	the	Tube
[London	subway]	and	picking	up	the	free	newspapers	they	hand	out.	Every	day,
the	headline	was	about	how	many	people	had	been	laid	off	in	the	City	the	day
before.	The	figure	was	always	in	the	tens	of	thousands.

**How	did	you	find	a	job	in	that	type	of	environment?**

I	was	able	to	get	a	three-month	contracting	job	doing	spreadsheet	work.	The
three	months	ended	up	being	extended	to	four	years—at	which	point,	I	quit	to
devote	full	time	to	trading.

**What	strategy	did	you	use	when	you	started	trading	managed	accounts?**

Initially,	I	started	by	combining	buy-and-hold	investing	with	macro	trading.	I


never	had	much	success	with	the	macro	trading	part.	I	didn’t	like	it	because	you
are	trading	huge	markets,	and	there	is	always	going	to	be	someone	out	there	who
knows	more	than	you	do.	My	first	significant	success	was	shorting	pump-and-
dump	stocks	on	the	OTC.	These	were	stocks	that	would	go	from	50	cents	to	$5
or	$10	on	virtually	nothing	and	then	collapse	in	a	day.	I	found	these	research
services	and	blogs	that	covered	penny	stocks.	Most	of	them	were	focused	on	the
pump,	but	I	was	interested	in	the	services	that	focused	on	shorting	these	stocks.

**I	understand	how	these	stocks	can	have	a	big	run-up	and	then	go	back	to
virtually	zero.	But,	to	me,	the	difficulty	seems	to	be	in	gauging	how	far	they
can	go.	If	a	worthless	stock	can	go	from	50	cents	to	$5,	it	can	just	as	easily
go	to	$10.	So	how	do	you	get	short	without	taking	a	huge	risk?**

Pump-and-dump	stocks	are	unique	in	their	price	action	compared	with	regular
stocks.	The	typical	pattern	would	be	for	the	stock	to	start	at	a	price	like	50	cents
and	then	go	up	every	day	by	20	or	30	cents.	The	critical	catalyst	was	when	the
stock	couldn’t	close	up	for	the	day;	that	would	signal	the	pump	was	struggling,
and	the	move	was	over.

**Are	you	literally	saying	that	these	stocks	would	go	up	in	stair-step	fashion
every	day,	until	the	first	day	they	didn’t,	and	then	they	would	go	straight
down?**

Yes,	after	the	first	down	day,	they	could	be	down	60%–70%	the	next	day.	It	was
such	 a	 great	 strategy	 because	 these	 stocks	 always	 moved	 up	 in	 a	 gradual,
controlled	 fashion.	 You	 never	 had	 the	 wild	 parabolic	 upmoves	 you	 can
sometimes	get	in	real	stocks.

**And	that	always	worked?	Did	you	ever	go	short	after	the	first	down	day,
and	then	have	the	stock	go	back	to	new	highs?**

I	never	had	a	significant	loss	in	selling	a	pump-and-dump	stock.	But,	you	would
only	get	one	of	these	opportunities	once	a	quarter	or	so.

**How	long	did	you	use	this	strategy?**

I	traded	it	about	a	year	or	two.

**Since	it	was	such	a	consistent	winner,	how	come	you	didn’t	use	it	longer?**

Getting	the	short	availability	was	very	hard,	and	the	strategy	was	not	scalable.
Also,	the	frauds	were	so	brazen	that	the	SEC	eventually	became	more	active	in
halting	trading	in	these	stocks.

**Given	that	you	only	had	a	handful	of	these	trades	per	year	for	two	years	or
less,	it	sounds	like	the	pump-and-dump	shorting	strategy	was	only	a	minor**


**part	of	your	portfolio.	What	was	the	basis	of	the	bulk	of	your	trades?**

My	 real	 niche	 outside	 of	 my	 core	 buy-and-hold	 investing	 has	 been	 trading
biotech	stocks,	which	probably	accounted	for	about	60%	of	my	profits	over	time.

**What	was	the	strategy	that	you	were	using?**

Biotech	stocks	are	excellent	trading	vehicles.	They	have	critical	catalysts,	such
as	clinical	results	for	phase	2	and	phase	3	trials,	which	are	make-or-break	events
for	 small	 biotechs.	 The	 variability	 of	 the	 valuation	 of	 these	 companies,
depending	 on	 the	 outcome	 of	 these	 trials,	 can	 provide	 great	 trading
opportunities.

**Biotech	 is	 a	 highly	 specialized	 area.	 How	 could	 you	 trade	 around	 such
events,	given	that	you	didn’t	have	any	background	in	biology	or	medicine?**

There	 are	 patterns	 in	 how	 these	 stocks	 behave	 that	 can	 be	 traded	 profitably
without	being	an	expert	in	the	field.	For	example,	in	a	healthy	market,	you	can
buy	small-cap	biotechs	two	or	three	months	before	a	critical	catalyst,	such	as	the
release	of	the	results	from	a	phase	3	trial.	I	would	buy	these	stocks	before	the
hype	started,	before	brokers	started	issuing	upgrades	on	the	stock,	and	before
retail	clients	started	buying	on	the	prospect	that	the	stocks	could	skyrocket	if	the
trial	results	were	successful.	And,	I	would	sell	the	stock	before	the	trial	results
were	 announced.	 Some	 stocks	 would	 double	 just	 on	 the	 expectation	 of	 the
release	of	trial	results.

**Did	 you	 have	 situations	 where	 these	 stocks	 trended	 down	 instead	 of	 up
going	into	the	trial	result	announcement?**

That	could	and	did	happen	when	the	general	market	had	a	correction.	However,
the	 major	 pitfall	 in	 the	 strategy	 was	 that	 you	 needed	 to	 know	 when	 the	 trial
results	 would	 be	 announced.	 Most	 small-cap	 bio	 stocks—I	 am	 talking	 about
companies	in	the	$100–$400	million	range—generally	have	low-quality	assets.
If	they	are	in	a	phase	3	trial	and	still	have	that	low	of	a	market	cap,	it	suggests	it
is	unlikely	they	are	onto	something.	All	the	big	pharma	companies	pick	over
companies	when	they	are	in	phase	1	and	phase	2,	and	the	fact	that	they	have
chosen	 not	 to	 be	 involved	 with	 a	 company	 in	 a	 phase	 3	 trial	 has	 negative
implications.

**Were	 there	 situations	 where	 you	 couldn’t	 narrow	 down	 when	 the	 trial
results	were	going	to	be	released?**

I	either	avoided	stocks	where	I	didn’t	have	any	idea	when	the	results	would	be
released,	 or	 I	 got	 out	 much	 earlier	 than	 I	 normally	 would	 to	 minimize	 the
possibility	of	still	being	in	the	stock	when	the	results	were	announced.


**Did	you	ever	get	caught	still	holding	a	stock	when	the	trial	results	were
announced?**

There	 were	 a	 couple	 of	 times	 when	 the	 trial	 results	 came	 out	 entirely
unexpectedly,	and	I	was	still	in	the	position.

**What	happens	in	a	case	like	that?**

You	lose	60%	or	70%	on	the	stock.

**Do	you	still	use	that	strategy?**

Just	a	little	bit.	It’s	a	pretty	minor	strategy	for	me	now.	Drug	pricing	in	the	States
is	a	big	issue,	and	biotech	has	been	an	underperforming	sector.

**What	other	types	of	strategies	do	you	use?**

Occasionally,	I	will	bet	on	trial	results	in	a	biotech	company.

**What	would	prompt	you	to	bet	on	the	direction	of	the	trial	results?**

There	are	circumstances	where	the	odds	for	failure	are	very	high,	even	if	you
don’t	know	anything	about	the	drug	itself.	For	example,	there	has	never	been	a
biotech	company	with	a	market	cap	under	$300	million	that	has	had	a	cancer
drug	pass	in	a	phase	3	trial.

**Is	that	because	if	the	drug	had	promise,	big	pharma	would	have	bought
them	out?**

That	or	the	market	cap	would	be	$1	billion	instead	of	$300	million.

**Could	you	sometimes	be	long	a	stock	in	the	period	before	the	trial	results
were	released	and	then	switch	to	short	going	into	the	result	announcement?**

Yes,	but	you	have	to	be	careful	about	the	short	side	because	there	could	always
be	a	surprise.	I	will	typically	use	puts	for	these	trades	rather	than	shorts.

**Are	there	other	strategies	you	use	to	trade	biotech	besides	the	two	we	have
just	discussed?**

Most	of	the	trades	I	do	in	biotech	are	short-term	trades—intraday	to	a	few	days
—and	most	of	them	are	on	the	short	side.

**What	drives	those	trades?**

Of	course,	the	main	news	items	in	biotech	relate	to	clinical	trial	results,	but	there
is	also	an	entire	realm	of	other	news	items	that	impact	biotech	stocks.	It	could	be
news	from	the	FDA;	it	could	be	the	release	of	additional	data	from	a	phase	3
trial;	 it	 could	 be	 some	 corporate	 announcement.	 The	 company	 might	 issue	 a
press	 announcement,	 and	 the	 stock	 could	 be	 up	 20%	 to	 30%.	 My	 job	 is	 to
decipher	whether	that	news	was	expected	and	whether	it	has	any	meaning	or	is


just	a	spin	job.	Biotech	is	a	funny	industry;	it	can	attract	horribly	promotional
management.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	that	type	of	trade?**

A	 good	 example	 is	 Avinger	 (AVGR)	 earlier	 this	 year	 [2019].	 They	 released
positive	phase	3	data,	and	the	next	day	the	stock	rallied	nearly	40%	from	the
previous	day’s	close.	However,	when	you	examined	the	press	release,	it	turned
out	that	it	was	follow-up	data	to	the	original	data	released	two	years	earlier.	So,
it	wasn’t	news.	Moreover,	the	fundamentals	of	the	company	were	negative,	with
weak	sales	and	large	debt.	I	went	short	and	was	out	within	two	days,	by	which
time	the	stock	had	given	back	its	entire	gain	and	then	some.

**Last	year	[2018]	was	your	first	losing	year.	What	went	wrong?**

I	was	down	4%,	which	was	precisely	in	line	with	the	S&P	performance.	My
longs	did	way	worse	than	the	S&P,	but	my	shorts	bailed	me	out.

**Why	did	your	longs	do	so	poorly?**

I	 was	 overexposed	 in	 Chinese	 stocks,	 which	 took	 a	 big	 hit	 on	 the	 trade	 war.
JD.com	was	my	biggest	loser.

**What	kind	of	company	are	they?**

They	are	the	Chinese	equivalent	of	Amazon.	I	originally	purchased	the	stock
around	$20	in	2016	when	it	was	trading	at	a	cheap	valuation.	The	stock	went	all
the	way	up	to	$50	by	early	2018.	I	took	profits	on	some	of	the	stock	at	higher
prices,	but	I	still	held	onto	about	two-thirds	of	the	position.	By	2018,	a	couple	of
things	had	changed	fundamentally.	The	company	was	no	longer	gaining	market
share,	and	other	Chinese	stocks	were	beginning	to	break	down.	Those	were	red
flags,	but	the	real	warning	sign	came	when	JD.com	announced	a	deal	in	which
Google	 would	 invest	 in	 the	 company	 and	 promote	 its	 products	 on	 Google’s
shopping	platform.	The	stock	gapped	higher	on	the	news,	opening	near	the	highs
of	the	day,	and	then	closed	sharply	lower.	I	should	have	been	out	before	that	day
on	the	changing	fundamentals,	but	the	worst	mistake	was	ignoring	that	day’s
price	action.	As	someone	who	trades	for	a	living,	I	should	have	known	better.
Over	the	next	few	months,	the	stock	went	back	down	to	$20.

**And	you	held	it	all	the	way	down?**

[He	laughs]	I	held	it	all	the	way	down.

**Had	you	ever	made	that	type	of	mistake	before?**

Yes,	when	I	first	started.

**Why	do	you	think	you	made	that	mistake	again	with	JD.com?**


Part	of	it	was	that	I	had	fallen	in	love	with	the	position.	Also,	I	had	been	doing
very	 well	 on	 my	 short-term	 trades,	 so	 I	 justified	 that	 I	 could	 hold	 on	 to	 the
position.

**What	happened	when	the	stock	went	back	down	to	$20?**

At	 $20,	 the	 stock	 valuation	 was	 ridiculously	 low	 again,	 so	 I	 added	 back	 the
portion	 of	 the	 position	 I	 had	 sold	 at	 higher	 levels.	 [Update:	 By	 spring	 2020,
JD.com	had	fully	recovered	and	moved	to	new	all-time	highs.]

**Is	all	your	short-term	trading	in	biotech?**

The	majority	is,	but	about	20%	of	my	short-term	trades	are	in	other	sectors.	As
an	 example,	 I	 recently	 shorted	 Beyond	 Meat	 (BYND)	 after	 McDonald’s
announced	they	were	going	to	experiment	using	their	product	in	some	of	their
Canadian	 restaurants.	 The	 market	 jumped	 from	 a	 closing	 price	 of	 $138	 to	 a
preopening	price	well	above	$160	on	the	news.

**Why	did	you	go	short?**

The	reasoning	was	similar	to	the	biotech	short	we	discussed.	It	was	great	that
McDonald’s	 announced	 they	 would	 test	 their	 product,	 but	 Beyond	 Meat	 had
been	issuing	these	types	of	announcements	ever	since	they	listed	the	stock,	and
McDonald’s	was	the	only	major	chain	left	that	they	hadn’t	made	a	deal	with.	So
this	news	was	entirely	to	be	expected.

**So,	you’re	saying	that	the	news	was	already	priced	into	the	stock.**

I	think	the	stock	was	pricing	in	a	lot	more	than	that.	After	listing	earlier	this	year
[2019],	the	stock	saw	a	parabolic	move	from	$45	to	$240	in	a	couple	of	months.
The	rally	was	so	extreme	because	the	stock	had	a	small	float,	and	there	was	a
short	squeeze.	Once	the	news	came	out	that	the	founders	were	selling	a	portion
of	their	holdings,	the	stock	collapsed	back	to	under	$140	in	less	than	two	weeks.
So,	another	reason	why	I	went	short	was	that	it	was	already	a	broken	stock	when
the	news	about	McDonald’s	came	out.	I	wouldn’t	have	stepped	in	front	of	that
news	if	the	stock	was	still	in	its	roaring	up	phase;	I	was	only	willing	to	go	short
because	the	character	of	the	stock	was	completely	changed.

**When	you	go	short	into	a	bullish	news	rally	like	that,	how	much	are	you
willing	to	risk	on	the	trade?**

For	a	trade	like	that,	I	would	use	a	stop	that	allows	the	stock	to	move	roughly
10%	against	me.	On	a	non-biotech	position,	I’ll	risk	only	about	30	basis	points
of	the	portfolio	and	size	the	position	accordingly.	On	biotech	stocks,	which	are
more	my	bread-and-butter	type	of	trades,	I	may	risk	closer	to	1%	of	the	portfolio


on	 a	 single	 trade	 and,	 sometimes,	 even	 as	 high	 as	 2%	 or	 3%	 if	 I	 have	 a
particularly	good	setup	on	the	trade.

**Is	there	a	structure	as	to	how	you	combine	your	different	strategies	into	a
portfolio?**

Generally,	 I	 will	 have	 roughly	 60%	 of	 the	 portfolio	 in	 long	 positions—a
percentage	that	can	vary	up	or	down,	depending	on	how	cheap	or	expensive	I
think	the	general	market	is—with	the	remaining	portfolio	utilized	for	short-term
trading	and	the	occasional	longer-term	biotech	short.	To	use	an	analogy	to	the
typical	60/40	long	equity/long	bond	portfolio,	where	the	bond	position	is	used
for	 diversification,	 in	 my	 60/40	 portfolio,	 short-term	 trading	 provides	 the
diversification.

**What	percent	of	your	short-term	trading	is	from	the	short	side?**

About	70%.

**How	do	you	select	the	stocks	in	the	long	position	portion	of	your	portfolio?**

My	long	book	can	be	broken	into	two	parts:	large-cap	stocks,	which	I	buy	when
they	are	getting	hammered	on	what	I	consider	indiscriminate	selling,	and	small-
cap	stocks	with	high	revenue	growth.

**Can	you	give	me	an	example	of	a	large-cap	stock	you	bought	because	of
indiscriminate	selling?**

One	long	I	currently	hold	is	Bayer,	which	acquired	Monsanto	a	little	over	a	year
ago.	Shortly	after	their	acquisition,	Monsanto	was	hit	by	a	massive	lawsuit	based
on	 claims	 that	 their	 weed	 killer	 caused	 cancer.	 It	 is	 trading	 at	 a	 40%–50%
discount	to	average	historical	valuation	levels.	You	could	argue	that	the	market	is
pricing	 in	 €30–€40	 billion	 of	 potential	 legal	 liabilities.	 The	 way	 I	 see	 it,
assuming	a	€30–€40	billion	liability	is	pretty	outrageous.	Other	than	for	tobacco,
there	has	 never	been	 any	 settlement	larger	 than	€10	 billion.	 I	expect	 that	 the
Monsanto	settlement	will	be	closer	to	€5–€10	billion.

**How	do	you	choose	your	small-cap	holdings?**

Typically,	I	am	looking	for	companies	that	are	growing	very	fast—at	least	20%
to	30%	revenue	growth	per	year—but	haven’t	reached	scale	yet.	So,	they	are
companies	that	are	probably	losing	money	at	the	moment,	but	if	they	execute
correctly,	they	will	have	reasonable	earnings-per-share	within	two	or	three	years
and	a	prospect	for	the	stock	doubling	or	tripling	in	that	time.	I	like	these	types	of
fast-growing	 stocks	 because	 if	 they	 hit	 their	 targets	 and	 start	 earning	 money,
there	is	a	catalyst	to	move	the	stock	price	higher.


**What	is	your	risk	management	process?**

In	a	recession,	the	market	will	typically	go	down	20%–30%.	Assuming	my	60%
long	portfolio	does	no	better	than	the	market,	it	will	lose	approximately	12%–
18%.	I	would	expect	my	short-term	trading	and	short	positions	to	cover	that	loss.

**So,	a	key	element	of	your	risk	management	is	your	portfolio	construction.
How	about	risk	management	in	individual	positions?**

On	my	catalyst	short	positions	where	I’m	looking	for	a	company	to	fail	on	an
upcoming	trial,	I	might	risk	1%–2%.	At	the	moment,	I’m	risking	more	than	that
on	one	trade	because	I’m	up	over	20%	year	to	date.	On	a	typical	short-term
trade,	like	the	Beyond	Meat	trade	we	discussed,	I	will	risk	30	basis	points.

**What	was	your	most	painful	trade?**

It	was	a	trade	I	did	in	2012,	which	was	early	in	my	career	when	I	didn’t	have	the
type	of	risk	management	controls	I	do	now.	It	was	a	technology	stock	called
Broad	 Vision	 (BVSN)	 that	 went	 up	 fourfold	 in	 just	 over	 a	 month.	 Even
management	 was	 saying	 they	 didn’t	 know	 why	 the	 stock	 was	 up	 so	 much.
Although	 it	 was	 a	 real	 company,	 the	 stock	 price	 moved	 just	 like	 one	 of	 the
pump-and-dump	stocks,	and	I	traded	it	the	same	way.	The	stock	had	gone	from
$8	to	over	$30	in	just	over	one	month,	and	I	shorted	it	the	first	time	it	broke
down.	But	unlike	the	pump-and-dump	stocks,	which	just	kept	on	going	down
once	their	uptrend	broke,	this	stock	reversed	back	sharply	to	the	upside.	It	nearly
doubled	on	me	within	a	few	days,	resulting	in	about	a	10%	loss	of	my	portfolio
value.	I	couldn’t	handle	it	anymore	and	capitulated.

**What	eventually	happened	to	the	stock?**

It	got	as	high	as	$56	and	then	went	all	the	way	back	down	to	$8.

**After	that,	did	you	ever	have	a	large	loss	on	a	single	trade?**

I	never	had	another	material	loss	in	the	trading	portion	of	my	portfolio.	My	big
losses	have	always	come	from	my	longs.

**I	assume	that	is	because	you	don’t	have	stops	on	your	investment	longs	since
you	count	on	the	trading	portion	of	your	portfolio,	which	is	primarily	short-
biased,	to	provide	a	hedge	on	your	longs.**

That’s	correct.

**Have	 there	 been	 any	 situations	 where	 you	 had	 a	 long	 position	 with	 a
substantial	loss,	and	you	decided	to	take	it	because	you	were	wrong	on	the
trade?**

In	2014,	I	was	up	35%	for	the	year	with	only	a	month	to	go,	so	it	felt	like	I	had


earned	the	right	to	take	more	risk	[he	laughs	at	the	recollection].	Unfortunately
for	me,	the	next	trade	idea	that	popped	up	was	triggered	by	the	price	slide	in	the
oil	and	gas	sector,	which	was	getting	completely	smoked	at	the	time.	I	started
loading	up	on—it’s	ridiculous	when	I	look	back	on	it	now—Russian	stocks	and
MLPs,	which	are	pipeline	distribution	companies.	The	stocks	had	gone	down
70%,	and	I	thought	they	wouldn’t	go	down	any	further,	except	they	did.

**And	these	were	part	of	your	long	portfolio,	so	there	were	no	stops.**

That’s	right.

**At	what	point	did	you	decide	to	get	out	because	you	were	wrong?**

I	got	out	two	weeks	later	when	I	was	down	7%	on	these	stocks.	If	I	had	stayed
with	those	positions	for	a	couple	more	weeks,	I	would	have	gotten	out	with	only
a	small	loss.	But	I	had	no	business	being	in	those	positions.

**Was	that	because	these	stocks	were	outside	your	normal	sphere?**

That’s	 right.	 They	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 my	 expertise.	 It	 was	 just	 reckless
trading.	Instead	of	waiting	for	a	good	set	up,	like	a	biotech	short,	I	went	crazy
buying	these	stocks,	which	I	knew	nothing	about,	just	because	they	were	down	a
lot.

**Was	that	the	only	time	you	strayed	from	your	approach	this	way?**

Yes,	since	then,	I’ve	been	disciplined	about	sticking	to	my	types	of	trades.

**What	do	you	know	now	that	you	wish	you	knew	when	you	started?**

You	want	to	be	underconfident	rather	than	overconfident.	When	I	was	a	new
trader,	 I	 would	 do	 some	 research	 on	 a	 stock	 and	 think	 I	 knew	 more	 than
everyone	else.	Now,	I	am	the	complete	opposite.	I	assume	I	am	the	dumb	one
and	trade	accordingly.	At	best,	my	success	rate	is	going	to	be	50%–70%.	So	I’m
always	looking	for	reasons	why	I	shouldn’t	be	in	the	trade	if	it’s	not	working.

**Do	you	do	anything	differently	when	you	are	in	a	losing	phase?**

I	still	keep	trading,	but	I	reduce	my	risk	per	trade.	If	I	would	typically	take	a	1%
risk	on	a	good	set	up,	I’ll	cut	it	down	to	30	basis	points.

**What	advice	would	you	give	to	someone	who	wants	to	be	a	trader?**

```
You	need	to	be	persistent.	Realize	that	it	is	a	long	road	to	develop	a	decent
edge.
You	need	to	know	your	edge	and	develop	your	trading	process	around	that
edge.
```

```
You	need	to	be	great	at	learning	from	your	mistakes.	Analyze	every	mistake
you	make	until	you	learn	something	from	it	and	then	incorporate	what	you
learn	into	your	process.
You	need	to	love	trading	so	that	you	can	get	through	the	tough	times.
```
It	 is	 ironic	 that	 trades	 that	 appear	 highly	 risky—e.g.,	 short	 biotech	 stock
positions	held	into	clinical	trial	announcements,	and	shorts	implemented	after
overnight	 price	 gaps	 triggered	 by	 corporate	 announcements—are	 a	 core
component	of	Kean’s	risk	mitigation	strategy.

Appropriate	risk	management	encompasses	two	tiers:	the	individual	trade	level
—limiting	the	loss	on	any	single	trade—and	the	portfolio	level.	At	the	portfolio
level,	 there	 are	 again	 two	 components.	 First,	 analogous	 to	 individual	 trades,
there	are	rules	to	limit	the	loss	for	the	portfolio	as	a	whole.	Such	rules	might
include	a	defined	process	for	reducing	exposure	as	a	loss	drawdown	deepens,	or
a	specified	percentage	loss	at	which	trading	is	halted.	The	second	element	of	risk
management	 at	 the	 portfolio	 level	 pertains	 to	 the	 portfolio	 composition.
Positions	 that	 are	 highly	 correlated	 would	 be	 limited	 to	 the	 extent	 feasible.
Ideally,	 the	 portfolio	 would	 include	 positions	 that	 are	 uncorrelated	 and,	 even
better,	inversely	correlated	with	each	other.

The	 concept	 of	 building	 a	 portfolio	 of	 uncorrelated	 and	 inversely	 correlated
positions	lies	at	the	heart	of	Kean’s	trading	philosophy.	Any	long-only	equity
portfolio	faces	the	problem	that	most	of	the	positions	will	be	highly	correlated.
The	 majority	 of	 Kean’s	 portfolio	 consists	 of	 a	 long	 equity	 component
(approximately	 60%	 on	 average,	 although	 this	 level	 can	 range	 depending	 on
Kean’s	assessment	of	the	prevailing	potential	return/risk	of	the	overall	equity
market).	Kean	solves	the	problem	of	a	long	equity	portfolio	inherently	consisting
of	highly	correlated	positions	by	combining	this	portion	of	his	portfolio	with	a
trading	strategy	that	is,	on	balance,	inversely	correlated	with	long	equities.

The	trading	portion	of	the	portfolio	consists	mostly	of	very	short-term	trades
and,	 to	 a	 lesser	 extent,	 longer-term	 short	 positions	 in	 the	 biotech	 sector.	 The
inverse	correlation	derives	from	the	fact	that	nearly	three-quarters	of	the	short-
term	trades,	as	well	as	the	longer-term	biotech	positions,	are	shorts.	Even	the
long	positions	in	the	trading	portion	of	the	portfolio	are	uncorrelated	to	the	long
equity	investment	holdings	because	they	are	day	trades	tied	to	company-specific


events.	By	combining	two	inversely	correlated	segments,	Kean	is	able	to	extract
the	long-term	appreciation	in	equities	without	the	typical	downside	exposure	of
long	equity	portfolios	in	bear	markets.

Kean’s	unique	method	for	hedging	his	long	equity	exposure,	which	relies	heavily
on	 shorting	 biotech	 stocks,	 is	 not	 applicable	 or	 advisable	 for	 most	 traders.
However,	it	is	not	the	specific	method	that	Kean	uses	to	reduce	portfolio	risk	that
is	 pertinent	 to	 readers.	 Instead,	 it	 is	 the	 concept	 of	 seeking	 uncorrelated	 and,
preferably,	inversely	correlated	positions	that	is	important.	Traders	need	to	not
only	focus	on	their	trades	but	also	pay	attention	to	how	these	trades	combine	in	a
portfolio.

Kean	also	applies	risk	management	at	the	individual	trade	level,	a	practice	that	is
particularly	 critical	 for	 short	 trades,	 which	 pose,	 theoretically,	 unlimited	 risk.
Kean	learned	the	importance	of	limiting	the	risk	on	individual	trades	early	in	his
career	when	he	shorted	a	stock	in	a	parabolic	upmove	without	a	plan	on	what	to
do	if	he	was	wrong.	The	stock	price	nearly	doubled	on	him	in	a	matter	of	days,
resulting	in	a	10%	hit	to	his	portfolio—his	worst	loss	ever.	He	never	repeated
this	mistake.	Kean	will	typically	limit	risk	to	1%	on	his	biotech	trades,	his	area
of	expertise,	and	to	only	30	basis	points	on	non-biotech	trades.	Also,	while	Kean
does	not	use	protective	stops	on	his	long	equity	positions,	large-cap	holdings	are
only	 entered	 after	 a	 sizeable	 retracement,	 limiting	 further	 downside	 scope	 in
these	positions.

Usually,	Kean	is	rigorous	in	taking	only	those	trades	that	fit	the	criteria	of	one	of
his	strategies.	In	late	2014,	though,	Kean	let	his	discipline	lapse.	He	was	up	35%
for	the	year,	with	only	one	month	left.	He	felt	he	had	earned	the	right	to	take
more	 risk,	 given	 his	 profit	 cushion.	 The	 trade	 he	 took—buying	 a	 group	 of
energy-related	stocks	because	the	sector	was	down	sharply—had	nothing	to	do
with	his	standard	methodology.	Within	two	weeks,	he	had	surrendered	7%	of	his
profits	for	the	year.	It	is	commonplace	for	traders	to	get	sloppy	when	they	are
doing	particularly	well.	Beware	of	letting	a	period	of	strong	performance	go	to
your	head.

Important	fundamental	news	that	results	in	counter-to-expected	price	action	can
often	 represent	 a	 critical	 signal.	 The	 price	 action	 in	 JD.com	 after	 the
announcement	of	a	deal	with	Google—an	initial	upmove	followed	by	a	sharply
lower	close—provided	a	perfect	example	of	this	principle,	as	the	stock	moved
sharply	lower	in	the	ensuing	period.


# Pavel	Krejčí: 	The	Bellhop	Who	Beat	the	Pros

# WHO	is	 Pavel	 Krejčí?^21 (Apologies	 to	 Ayn	 Rand.)	 That	 is	 what	 I	 wondered

when	I	saw	his	account	consistently	show	up	in	the	top	10	and	often	top	five
traders	on	the	FundSeeder.com	leaderboard.	FundSeeder.com	is	a	website	that
provides	traders	with	free	performance	analytics	and	the	ability	to	create	verified
track	records	by	linking	their	brokerage	accounts	to	the	site.	(Full	disclosure:	As
a	founding	partner,	I	have	a	financial	interest	in	FundSeeder.)

Every	 time	 I	 looked,	 Krejčí’s	 equity	 curve	 showed	 a	 steadily	 rising	 trend,
virtually	quarter	after	quarter.	The	return	stream	was	Madoff-like,	except,	in	this
case,	I	knew	the	numbers	were	real	because	Krejčí’s	account	was	“verified.”	(As
a	linked	account,	his	returns	were	received	directly	from	a	prominent	brokerage
firm.)	Finally,	I	called	Krejčí	to	get	the	story	behind	his	incredible	performance.
Here	is	what	I	discovered.

Krejčí	lives	in	the	Czech	Republic.	After	graduating	high	school,	he	did	a	year	of
military	service.	He	then	worked	as	a	bellhop	in	Prague	for	ten	years.	Midway
through	this	job,	Krejčí	opened	a	restaurant,	while	still	maintaining	his	bellhop
job	because	he	needed	the	money.	During	this	period,	he	worked	14-hour	days
between	his	job	and	business.	The	restaurant	failed	after	10	months.	“I	couldn’t
manage	people,”	Krejčí	says	in	explaining	his	unsuccessful	venture.

While	still	working	as	a	bellhop,	Krejčí	opened	a	stock	account	with	$20,000,
hoping	to	establish	a	trading	career.	His	first	foray	into	trading	did	not	go	well.
After	losing	80%	of	his	starting	stake	in	six	months,	he	closed	his	account	at
year-end	2005.	Krejčí	spent	the	next	six	months	researching	and	developing	a
methodology.	 By	 mid-2006,	 he	 felt	 confident	 he	 was	 onto	 something.	 Krejčí
opened	another	stock	account	with	$27,000,	which	included	money	he	borrowed
from	 his	 brother.	 Within	 a	 little	 over	 a	 year,	 he	 had	 more	 than	 doubled	 his
account	and	felt	confident	enough	to	quit	his	bellhop	job.

Krejčí	is	a	long-only	equities	trader	with	a	14-year	track	record	that	trounces
99%	 plus	 of	 long-only	 professional	 managers.	 I	 would	 bet	 that	 last	 sentence
would	 be	 accurate	 using	 99.9%	 instead	 of	 99%,	 but	 I	 don’t	 have	 the	 data	 to
verify.

For	the	first	2-1/2	years	after	resuming	trading	(mid-2006	through	2008),	Krejčí
achieved	an	average	annual	compounded	return	of	48%.	Even	more	impressive
than	his	average	annual	return	level	during	this	period	is	the	fact	that	he	was	up


13%	 in	 2008	 trading	 a	 long-only	 equity	 strategy—a	 year	 when	 the	 S&P	 500
index	 was	 down	 37%!	 Unfortunately,	 Krejčí	 only	 had	 annual	 statements
available	for	these	early	years,	so	I	could	not	include	them	in	calculating	his
return/risk	statistics.

For	 the	 subsequent	 11-1/2	 years,	 Krejčí’s	 average	 annual	 compounded	 return
was	35.0%	(versus	13.6%	for	the	S&P	500),	with	a	maximum	drawdown	of	only
13.2%	based	on	daily	data	(7.0%	using	month-end	data).	His	return/risk	metrics
were	outstanding:	an	adjusted	Sortino	ratio	of	3.6,	a	monthly	Gain	to	Pain	ratio
of	6.7,	and	a	daily	Gain	to	Pain	ratio	of	0.81	(see	Appendix	2	for	the	definitions
and	 interpretation	 of	 these	 statistics).	 These	 return/risk	 statistics	 are	 between
three	to	seven	times	the	corresponding	S&P	500	levels.	Krejčí’s	outperformance
versus	the	S&P	500	would	have	been	substantially	greater	if	his	earlier	years
could	have	been	included	in	these	calculations.	Krejčí’s	performance	has	also
been	remarkably	consistent:	He	had	positive	returns	in	93%	of	all	quarters.

Krejčí	has	the	distinction	of	having	by	far	the	smallest	account	of	anyone	ever
included	in	a	 _Market	Wizards_ 	book.	His	trading	account	has	generally	ranged
between	 $50,000	 and	 $80,000.	 Krejčí	 trades	 only	 stocks	 with	 extremely	 high
volume,	so	his	methodology	could	easily	be	applied	to	a	much	larger	portfolio.
Given	the	liquidity	of	the	stocks	he	trades	and	his	exceptional	performance,	why
is	 his	 account	 size	 so	 small?	 The	 answer	 is	 straightforward:	 Krejčí	 uses	 his
trading	profits	to	pay	for	living	expenses.	So,	although	his	returns	have	been
consistently	excellent,	he	has	never	been	able	to	build	his	account	size.

I	interviewed	Krejčí	during	the	2020	pandemic,	which	ruled	out	travel	and	a
personal	meeting.	So	our	“meeting”	was	via	Zoom.

How	was	Krejčí	able	to	achieve	his	exceptional	performance	using	a	long-only
equity	strategy?	That	was	the	main	subject	of	our	interview.

**I	know	you	ended	your	education	after	high	school.	Did	you	consider	going
to	university?**

I	was	not	a	very	good	student.	It’s	funny	now,	but	I	remember	my	high	school
economics	 teacher	 telling	 me,	 “Pavel,	 you	 will	 never	 do	 any	 job	 that	 has
anything	 to	 do	 with	 economics.”	 The	 high	 school	 grading	 system	 ranged
between	1	and	5,	with	1	being	best	and	5	being	worst.	I	had	a	3	in	economics.	I
did	even	worse	in	math,	in	which	I	got	a	4.	I	knew	I	wouldn’t	survive	one	day	at


a	university.	I	don’t	think	that	education	is	that	important	in	trading;	a	passion
for	learning	how	to	trade	is	far	more	crucial.

**What	gave	you	the	inspiration	to	start	trading?**

When	I	worked	at	the	hotel,	I	saw	many	businessmen	reading	 _The	Wall	Street
Journal_ 	or	the	 _Financial	Times_ .	I	thought,	“What	a	great	job,	just	to	sit	there,
read	the	newspaper,	and	make	some	calls	to	place	trades.”	I	thought	that	trading
for	a	living	would	be	a	great	life.	Of	course,	I	didn’t	have	any	experience,	and	I
didn’t	know	anything.	In	2005,	I	opened	a	stock	account	to	start	trading.

**Were	you	trading	US	stocks?**

I	traded	US	stocks	from	the	very	beginning.

**What	did	you	read	to	get	some	knowledge	about	the	markets	and	trading?**

I	read	some	local	books	on	technical	analysis.	I	also	read	your	 _Market	Wizards_
book,	which	was	translated	to	Czech.

**What	was	your	trading	approach	when	you	began?**

I	had	no	approach	at	all.	If	a	stock	looked	like	it	was	going	up,	I	would	buy	it.	I
didn’t	use	stops,	which	was	my	biggest	problem.

**How	large	was	the	account?**

$20,000.

**What	happened	with	that	account?**

I	 lost	 half	 the	 money	 and	 stopped	 trading.	 I	 was	 bad	 at	 trading,	 but	 an	 even
bigger	problem	was	that	I	was	using	a	local	broker	and	paying	$10	round	turn
for	 100	 shares.	 If	 you	 are	 paying	 those	 type	 of	 commission	 levels,	 it	 is
impossible	to	make	money	day	trading.

**How	long	did	you	stop	trading	for?**

I	didn’t	trade	for	a	little	over	half	a	year.	I	saved	some	money	to	add	to	the
account	and	borrowed	another	$5,000	from	my	brother	so	I	would	have	enough
money	to	place	at	least	three	day-trades	a	day.

**Did	you	develop	a	methodology	in	the	interim?**

Yes.	 It	 was	 similar	 to	 the	 same	 method	 that	 I	 still	 use	 today.	 The	 biggest
difference	 was	 that,	 at	 that	 time,	 I	 didn’t	 pay	 any	 attention	 to	 the	 volume	 or
liquidity	of	the	stocks	I	traded.

**Were	you	still	working	as	a	bellhop	during	this	time?**

Yes.	I	waited	until	I	had	a	full	year	of	profitable	trading	before	I	quit	my	job,
which	I	did	near	the	end	of	2007.


**So,	since	then,	have	you	supported	yourself	on	your	trading	profits?**

Yes,	and	I	also	made	a	little	money	at	the	beginning	in	sports	betting.	It	was	not
hard	to	beat	some	bookies.	But	when	they	know	what	you	are	doing,	they	kick
you	out.

**What	sports	were	you	betting	on?**

All	sports.	The	sport	didn’t	make	any	difference.

**What	was	your	betting	method?**

It’s	called	sure	betting;	it’s	a	type	of	arbitrage.

**Since	the	bookies	will	take	a	cut,	how	can	you	have	an	arbitrage?**

You	bet	on	both	sides.	For	example,	let’s	say	there	is	a	match	between	Germany
and	England.	I	would	simultaneously	bet	on	Germany	with	England	bookies	and
on	England	with	German	bookies.

**Are	 you	 saying	 that	 the	 odds	 would	 be	 different	 in	 different	 countries,
depending	on	who	the	favorite	was?**

Yes.	Since	most	people	bet	on	their	national	team,	the	bookies	have	to	adjust
their	odds	shortly	before	the	match,	decreasing	the	payoff	on	the	national	team
and	increasing	the	payoff	on	the	foreign	team.	There	is	a	short	time	window
when	arbitrage	can	occur—usually	only	a	few	seconds.	You	have	to	be	quick	to
catch	it.	The	profit	on	the	bets	was	very	small,	but	you	couldn’t	lose.	I	did	it	for
about	a	year	and	a	half	until	they	stopped	taking	my	bets	and	closed	my	account.

**How	long	did	it	take	you	to	develop	your	trading	methodology?**

A	little	over	one	year.	At	the	time,	I	was	still	working	a	full-time	job.	I	was
probably	spending	16	hours	a	day	between	my	job,	stock	research,	and	trading.

**Did	you	try	approaches	you	discarded?**

In	the	beginning,	I	tried	lots	of	things,	including	longer-term	trading,	but	I	found
that	it	just	wasn’t	my	nature	to	hold	trades.

**So	what	did	you	find	that	worked	for	you?**

I	looked	for	stocks	that	moved	a	lot	in	one	day.	I	looked	at	stock	charts	back	to
1997,	and	I	noticed	that	for	many	stocks	there	were	four	times	a	year	when	there
was	a	particularly	big	daily	move.	At	first,	I	wondered	why	that	happened.	Then
I	found	out	that	these	price	moves	were	caused	by	earnings	reports.	I	discovered
similarities	in	the	price	action	in	stocks	the	day	after	earnings	that	held	as	far
back	as	I	had	data,	which	was	1997.

**Since	 you	 are	 trading	 just	 on	 earnings	 reports,	 I	 assume	 most	 of	 your**


**trading	is	concentrated	in	a	minority	of	trading	days.**

Yes,	most	of	my	trades	occur	in	the	approximate	month-long	period	each	quarter
in	which	most	earnings	reports	are	released.	Some	earnings	reports	are	released
outside	of	these	periods.	So	I	would	say	my	year	breaks	down	as	four	months	in
which	 I	 make	 most	 of	 my	 trades,	 three	 months	 of	 lighter	 trading,	 and	 five
months	when	I	focus	on	research.

**What	kind	of	research	do	you	do?**

I	review	my	previous	trades	to	see	how	I	could	have	done	better.	For	example,	I
try	to	answer	questions	such	as:	Would	I	have	done	better	if	I	held	the	trade
longer?

**You	do	that	trade	research	manually?**

Yes,	manually.	I	would	say	my	job	is	95%	analyst	and	5%	trader.	I	am	not	a
frequent	trader.	I	have	to	see	a	high-percentage	opportunity	before	I	take	a	trade.

**How	large	is	the	universe	of	stocks	that	you	follow?**

About	200–300.

**Do	those	stocks	share	some	common	characteristics?**

They	are	stocks	that	have	very	high	daily	volume.	On	the	days	after	earnings
reports,	 which	 is	 when	 I	 trade,	 the	 average	 volume	 of	 the	 stocks	 is	 5	 to	 10
million	shares.

**Since	your	trading	size	is	minimal	and	liquidity	is	not	an	issue,	why	is	high
volume	the	most	important	characteristic?**

Many	years	ago,	I	thought	that	I	might	one	day	be	able	to	trade	a	much	larger
account.	So	 I	switched	 from	 trading	any	 stock	to	 just	 those	stocks	 with	 high
liquidity.

**Was	 your	 motivation	 then	 that	 if	 you	 were	 successful	 and	 were	 able	 to
attract	assets	to	manage,	you	could	continue	to	use	the	same	methodology?**

Exactly.

**Do	you	take	both	long	and	short	trades	after	earnings	reports?**

No,	I	will	only	be	a	buyer.	I	never	go	short.

**What	percent	of	your	trades	are	made	following	bullish	earnings	reports	as
opposed	to	bearish	earnings	reports?**

I	 would	 say	 that	 80%	 of	 my	 trades	 and	 90%	 of	 my	 profits	 are	 in	 stocks	 in
uptrends	with	bullish	reports.

**Will	you	ever	buy	a	stock	that	has	a	bullish	report	but	is	in	a	downtrend?**


Yes,	but	such	trades	are	infrequent.	I	may	buy	a	stock	that	is	in	a	downtrend	if	it
is	in	a	prevailing	strong	sector	because	then	the	stock	trend	is	less	important.

**I	assume	the	rationale	for	buying	after	a	bullish	earnings	report	is	that	the
markets	don’t	fully	discount	the	report	at	the	opening	and	that	if	you	time
your	entry	correctly,	there	is	still	a	profit	opportunity.	But	what	would	be
the	rationale	for	buying	after	a	bearish	earnings	report?**

Some	stocks	that	are	in	downtrends	and	have	a	large	short	interest	can	be	so
oversold	that	they	will	have	a	positive	reaction,	even	if	the	earnings	report	is
bearish.

**There	are	four	combinations	of	report	implication	and	stock	trend:**

```
1 .	 stock	uptrend,	bullish	report
2 .	 stock	uptrend,	bearish	report
3 .	 stock	downtrend,	bullish	report
4 .	 stock	downtrend,	bearish	report
```
**You	said	that	90%	of	your	profits	come	from	category	1.	Why	then	even
bother	with	trades	in	the	other	three	categories.**

The	 category	 1	 trades	 also	 have	 the	 highest	 return-to-risk.	 The	 problem,
however,	 is	 that	 among	 the	 stocks	 I	 follow,	 it	 is	 not	 always	 possible	 to	 find
enough	trades	in	which	both	the	stock	is	in	an	uptrend	and	the	report	is	bullish.
So,	it	is	necessary	to	supplement	category	1	trades	with	less	frequent	trades	from
the	other	three	categories.

**What	do	you	look	for	in	deciding	whether	to	take	a	trade	in	a	stock	after	an
earnings	report?**

I	have	charts	for	the	post-earnings-reports	price	action	going	back	about	15	years
for	all	the	stocks	I	trade.	I	look	at	how	the	stocks	behaved	after	earnings	when
they	were	in	uptrends	versus	sideways	markets	or	downtrends.	The	best	trades
are	when	the	general	market	is	sideways	to	down,	and	the	stock	is	in	an	uptrend
and	 has	 a	 bullish	 report.	 That	 is	 when	 you	 can	 see	 the	 stock’s	 independent
strength	rather	than	just	a	reflection	of	a	rising	market.

**Are	there	other	price	patterns	you	look	for?**

Yes,	the	best	situations	are	when	the	stock	is	an	uptrend	and	there	is	a	pullback
before	the	earnings	report	because	people	are	worried	about	what	the	report	will
say.	If	the	report	is	then	bullish,	there	will	tend	to	be	immediate	strong	buying


from	people	who	got	out	before	the	report.

**Is	there	any	other	pattern	that	makes	a	stock	a	good	candidate	for	a	buy
after	an	earnings	report?**

Yes,	if	the	last	earnings	report	was	bearish,	more	longs	will	cover	before	the
earnings	report	because	they	will	be	concerned	about	a	repeat	occurrence.	If	the
earnings	report	is	bullish,	many	of	these	liquidated	longs	will	be	buyers.

**I	can	think	of	another	reason	why	a	prior	bearish	earnings	report	combined
with	 an	 uptrend	 in	 the	 stock	 is	 a	 bullish	 indicator.	 Essentially,	 that
combination	implies	that	the	stock	was	able	to	resume	its	uptrend	after	a
prior	bearish	earnings	report.	The	ability	of	the	stock	to	shrug	off	bearish
news	is	itself	a	bullish	indicator.**

**Are	there	other	types	of	things	you	look	at	in	deciding	whether	you	will	take
a	trade	after	an	earnings	report?**

I	consider	questions	such	as:	How	much	did	they	beat	earnings	estimates	by?
How	big	is	the	short	interest?	What	is	the	pre-open	volume?	What	is	the	pre-
open	price	move?

**Does	the	decision	of	whether	there	is	a	trade	depend	on	the	stock	having	a
specific	minimum	percentage	price	response	to	the	earnings	report?**

Yes,	that	is	exactly	right.

**Do	you	trade	all	stocks	the	same	way,	or	are	there	differences	in	the	way	you
trade	different	stocks?**

I	use	the	same	type	of	analysis	for	all	stocks.	I	will	also	have	a	protective	stop	on
every	trade	I	do.

**How	much	would	you	risk	on	any	particular	trade?**

I	will	place	my	stop	about	4%	to	5%	below	the	entry	price.

**Do	you	enter	the	stop	at	the	same	time	you	enter	your	order?**

I	will	place	the	stop	order	one	second	after	I	enter	the	trade.

**Do	you	trade	in	the	pre-open	market	following	an	earnings	report	release,
or	do	you	wait	until	the	official	opening?**

I	wait	until	the	opening.	But	the	pre-open	market	action	in	the	stock	is	one	of	the
most	 important	 things	 I	 watch.	 I	 also	 pay	 particular	 attention	 to	 the
commentaries	and	the	revised	targets	by	the	analysts	following	the	stock.	I	keep
a	notebook	of	what	all	the	analysts	have	said	in	the	past	about	a	stock.	What
were	their	past	price	targets?	How	have	they	changed	their	price	targets?	What
are	they	saying	now	compared	to	what	they	said	three	years	ago?	How	did	the


stock	respond	to	analyst	upgrades	and	downgrades	in	the	past?	There	is	a	saying
that	the	analysts	are	always	wrong.	Yes,	that	may	be	generally	true,	but	the	day
after	an	earnings	report,	some	of	their	upgrades	and	downgrades	can	be	critical
to	the	market	price	action.

**Do	you	enter	on	the	open?**

I	will	get	in	anywhere	between	a	few	minutes	to	a	half-hour	after	the	opening.	I
will	 always	 put	 in	 my	 order	 during	 the	 first	 half-hour	 when	 the	 volume	 is
greatest.

**Why	do	you	wait	to	get	in	until	after	the	open	as	opposed	to	on	the	open?**

Because	 at	 the	 open	 and	 right	 after	 the	 open,	 the	 bid-ask	 spreads	 can	 be
extremely	wide,	and	you	can	get	a	very	bad	fill.	Also,	I	need	to	wait	for	the
market	to	calm	down	before	I	can	place	my	stop.	If	I	buy	and	place	my	stop	in
the	first	few	minutes	of	trading,	there	is	a	much	higher	chance	of	getting	stopped
out,	even	if	the	trade	is	correct.

**Do	you	wait	for	a	pullback	to	get	in,	or	do	you	get	in	shortly	after	the	open?**

It	 depends	 on	 the	 historical	 pattern	 for	 the	 stock.	 Different	 stocks	 behave
differently.	Some	stocks	tend	to	have	a	pullback	after	the	opening,	while	other
stocks	 tend	 to	 move	 straight	 up.	 For	 example,	 in	 the	 situation	 we	 discussed
before,	stocks	in	which	the	previous	earnings	report	was	bearish,	I	will	usually
be	 a	 buyer	 very	 soon	 after	 the	 open	 because	 I	 expect	 the	 stock	 to	 move
immediately.

**How	do	you	decide	where	to	get	out?**

It	depends	on	the	price	action.	Sometimes	there	will	be	a	huge	price	jump	in	the
stock	early	in	the	day,	especially	for	stocks	with	a	large	short	interest,	and	I	will
take	profits.	But	if	there	is	no	significant	price	response,	I	will	usually	wait	until
the	close	to	get	out.

**Are	there	any	trades	that	stand	out	as	being	particularly	painful?**

When	I	was	starting	out,	there	was	one	trade	where	I	lost	30%	of	my	equity.	I
bought	a	stock—I	don’t	even	remember	the	name.	At	first,	it	went	up,	but	then	it
started	 going	 down.	 I	 kept	 thinking	 it	 would	 go	 up	 again,	 but	 it	 never	 did.	 I
didn’t	have	any	stop	on	the	trade.

**How	long	did	you	hold	the	stock?**

I	held	it	for	many	weeks.	It	was	my	biggest	mistake.	After	that	trade,	I	never
kept	a	stock	overnight.

**Was	that	also	the	point	at	which	you	started	using	stops	on	every	trade?**


Yes.	If	I	didn’t	use	stops,	my	percentage	of	winning	trades	would	be	higher,	and
my	returns	would	probably	be	very	similar,	but	my	drawdowns	would	be	much
larger.

**What	percent	of	your	trades	are	profitable?**

About	65%.

**Are	your	wins	larger	than	your	losers?**

My	average	win	is	about	1.5	times	as	large	as	my	average	loss.

**Besides	not	having	a	stop	on	the	trade	that	caused	the	big	loss,	have	you
made	other	trading	mistakes	since	then?**

I	 would	 say	 my	 biggest	 mistake	 has	 been	 not	 being	 aggressive	 enough.	 The
method	I	use	could	make	more	money	if	I	wasn’t	such	a	very	risk-averse	person.
If	I	had	a	15%	or	20%	drawdown,	I	would	be	out	of	the	business.	Three	losing
trades	in	a	row	is	very	painful	for	me.

**Roughly	speaking,	it	seems	that	whatever	you	make	each	year	you	pull	out
of	the	account,	and	your	trading	account	stays	about	the	same	size.**

All	the	money	I	make	in	my	trading,	I	spend	on	my	living	expenses.	It	is	sad	to
see	my	account	still	at	about	the	same	size	it	was	10	years	ago.	But	that	is	the
reality.

**What	would	happen	if	you	had	a	year	where	you	didn’t	make	any	money?**

If	I	didn’t	make	any	money	for	one	year,	I	could	survive.	If	I	didn’t	make	any
money	for	two	years,	I	would	have	to	quit.	It	would	be	the	end	of	trading	for	me.

**Are	you	happy	with	your	life	as	a	trader?**

I	am.	It	fits	me	well.	I	prefer	to	be	on	my	own.	I	don’t	feel	comfortable	in	large
groups.	I	am	happy	fishing,	taking	walks	in	the	forest,	working	on	my	garden,
and	trading.	These	are	all	activities	I	can	do	by	myself.	I	know	I	am	only	an
average	person	with	an	average	education.	Years	ago,	when	I	searched	for	what	I
could	do,	I	knew	I	wanted	to	find	something	where	the	success	or	failure	would
depend	only	on	me,	not	my	colleagues,	my	boss,	or	anybody	else.	If	I	make
money,	that’s	great;	if	I	lose	money,	it’s	my	mistake.	Trading	is	great	in	this	way.
You	can’t	find	many	other	activities	where	success	or	failure	depends	only	on
you.

**Why	do	you	believe	you	have	been	successful	as	a	trader?**

I	don’t	know	that	I	am	a	successful	trader,	but	any	success	I	have	had	is	because
I	hate	losing.	I	work	extremely	hard	when	I	am	losing.	When	I	am	losing,	I	can’t
focus	on	anything	else	besides	figuring	out	how	to	improve	what	I	am	doing.	In


this	way,	my	losing	periods	are	actually	beneficial	to	my	future	trading.

Perhaps	 the	 most	 important	 message	 in	 this	 interview	 is	 that	 it	 can	 be	 done.
Given	the	tremendous	growth	in	the	quantification	of	trading	in	the	past	two
decades,	many	individual	traders	and	investors	wonder	whether	it	is	still	possible
for	them	to	succeed.	Indeed,	it	is	entirely	reasonable	to	ask	how	a	solo	trader	can
compete	against	a	plethora	of	management	firms	with	scores	of	PhDs.

It	is	true	that	the	majority	of	individual	market	participants	will	not	succeed,	in
the	 sense	 of	 outperforming	 the	 relevant	 benchmark,	 such	 as	 a	 passive	 stock
index	investment—and	by	this	gauge,	neither	will	the	majority	of	professional
managers.	However,	Krejčí	demonstrates	that	success	and	superior	performance
are	still	possible	for	the	individual	trader.	Krejčí	had	no	education	beyond	high
school,	no	mentors,	and	minimal	funds.	Yet	he	developed	a	methodology	that
has	achieved	performance	characteristics	that	far	surpass	those	of	well	over	99%
of	long-only	equity	managers	and	hedge	funds.	He	has	also	supported	himself
for	14	years	off	his	trading	profits.

Krejčí	chose	trading	as	a	career	path	because	he	sought	an	endeavor	in	which	he
would	 be	 responsible	 for	 his	 success	 or	 failure.	 The	 operative	 word	 here	 is
_responsibility_ .	 Winning	 traders	 understand	 they	 are	 responsible	 for	 their
outcomes.	If	they	lose	money,	they	will	give	you	one	of	two	explanations.	Either
they	followed	their	methodology,	and	the	losing	trade	was	within	the	percentage
of	 losing	 trades	 that	 is	 inevitable,	 or	 they	 made	 a	 mistake—a	 fault	 they	 will
completely	 own.	 Losing	 traders,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 will	 always	 have	 some
excuse	for	why	they	lost.	They	followed	someone	else’s	bad	advice;	the	market
was	wrong;	high-frequency	traders	distorted	prices,	etc.	Politics	aside,	I	would
bet	that	President	Trump	would	be	an	awful	trader	because	he	has	never	taken
responsibility	for	any	mistake	or	failure.

Krejčí	provides	one	more	example	of	a	trader	who	ultimately	succeeded	because
he	found	a	methodology	that	fit	his	personality.	He	was	uncomfortable	holding
positions	overnight—“It	wasn’t	my	nature	to	hold	trades,”	he	says.	By	focusing
on	 trading	 stocks	 only	 on	 the	 day	 after	 earnings	 reports,	 Krejčí	 was	 able	 to
develop	a	strategy	that	could	generate	significant	returns,	at	acceptable	risk,	on
day	 trades.	 The	 lesson	 is	 that	 to	 succeed	 in	 the	 markets,	 you	 have	 to	 find	 a
methodology	 that	 you	 are	 comfortable	 trading.	 If	 there	 is	 anything	 in	 your
approach	that	is	uncomfortable,	you	need	to	figure	out	how	to	change	it.


One	 characteristic	 that	 has	 been	 common	 in	 so	 many	 of	 the	 traders	 I	 have
interviewed	is	that	they	have	a	strong	work	commitment.	To	develop	his	trading
methodology,	Krejčí	had	to	put	in	16-hour	days	between	his	day	job	and	market
research.	Even	though	his	method	results	in	virtually	no	trading	opportunities	in
five	months	of	the	year,	he	will	still	devote	full-time	to	the	markets	in	those
months,	using	those	down	months	to	continue	his	market	research.

Krejčí	 attributes	 his	 long-term	 success	 to	 how	 he	 responds	 to	 losing	 periods.
Whenever	he	is	in	a	drawdown,	he	becomes	obsessively	focused	on	research	that
can	lead	to	improvements	in	his	methodology.

One	 critical	 element	 that	 has	 enabled	 Krejčí	 to	 achieve	 his	 exceptional
return/risk	performance	is	his	restrictiveness	in	the	trades	he	places.	Krejčí	will
only	take	what	he	perceives	to	be	high-percentage	trades.	Many	traders	could
improve	their	performance	by	trading	less—passing	on	the	marginal	trades	and
waiting	for	high-probability	opportunities.

Although	Krejčí’s	edge	comes	from	his	trade	selection	and	the	timing	of	entry
and	exit,	it	is	risk	management	that	has	made	it	possible	for	him	to	continue	to
profit	 from	 his	 methodology.	 There	 are	 two	 ingredients	 in	 Krejčí’s	 risk
management.	First,	his	approach	avoids	the	risk	of	holding	positions	overnight.
Second,	he	places	a	stop	on	every	trade,	thereby	limiting	his	loss	on	any	single
trade.	Krejčí	explains	that	without	stops,	his	percentage	of	winning	trades	would
be	higher,	and	his	returns	would	be	about	the	same,	but	his	drawdowns	would	be
deeper.	 Since	 larger	 drawdowns	 could	 easily	 have	 forced	 Krejčí	 to	 abandon
trading,	risk	management	has	been	instrumental	to	his	long-term	success.

# Conclusion:	46	Market	Wizard	Lessons

# THIS	chapter	summarizes	the	key	lessons	to	be	gleaned	across	all	the	interviews

in	 _Unknown	Market	Wizards_ .	While	the	11	traders	interviewed	each	approach	the
market	 in	 their	 own	 unique	 and	 individual	 way,	 the	 insights	 from	 these
interviews	nevertheless	contain	important	general	lessons	for	all	traders.

Readers	of	other	 _Market	Wizard_ 	books	will	note	that	there	is	significant	overlap
with	 analogous	 summaries	 in	 those	 books.	 This	 observation	 should	 hardly	 be
surprising	since	the	advice	of	great	traders	reflects	basic	market	truths	that	are
invariant	 to	 methodology	 or	 time	 period.	 Some	 of	 the	 lessons	 that	 follow,
however,	 are	 unique	 to	 _Unknown	 Market	 Wizards_ —insofar	 as	 the	 ensuing
summary	is	based	solely	on	the	interviews	in	this	book.

**1.	There	Is	No	Single	True	Path**
After	reading	this	book,	it	should	be	clear	that	there	is	no	single	formula	for
succeeding	 in	 the	 markets.	 The	 paths	 the	 traders	 interviewed	 traveled	 in
achieving	 their	 exceptional	 performance	 were	 widely	 varied.	 The	 approaches
ranged	from	fundamental	to	technical,	to	a	combination	of	both,	to	neither.	Trade
holding	periods	ranged	from	minutes	to	months.	Trading	success	is	not	about
finding	the	 _right_ 	approach	but	instead	finding	the	 _right	approach	for	you_ .	No	one
can	tell	you	what	that	approach	is;	it	is	something	you	need	to	discover.
**2.	Find	a	Trading	Method	that	is	Compatible	with	Your	Personality**
Even	an	excellent	methodology	will	yield	poor	results	if	it	is	not	consistent	with
your	beliefs	and	comfort	zone.	To	succeed,	traders	must	find	their	own	market
approach.	Some	examples:

```
Dhaliwal	started	out	using	technical	methods.	He	felt	uncomfortable	with
the	 approach	 because	 he	 didn’t	 understand	 why	 it	 should	 work,	 and,
consequently,	he	didn’t	have	any	confidence	that	it	would	continue	to	work
in	the	future.	Dhaliwal	became	enormously	successful	when	he	switched	to
using	 fundamentals—an	 approach	 where	 he	 felt	 he	 had	 a	 much	 clearer
understanding	of	why	prices	moved	from	one	level	to	another.
Neither	fundamental	nor	technical	analysis	appealed	to	Camillo,	so	he	came
up	 with	 a	 third	 market	 analysis	 category,	 social	 arbitrage—profiting	 by
```

```
spotting	a	societal	shift	or	trend	that	will	impact	a	stock	and	has	not	yet
been	reflected	by	the	stock	price.
Krejčí	was	uncomfortable	holding	positions	overnight.	He	dealt	with	this
strong	 personal	 aversion	 to	 overnight	 risk	 by	 developing	 a	 strategy	 that
could	generate	significant	returns,	at	acceptable	risk,	on	day	trades.
```
The	lesson	is	that	to	succeed	in	the	markets,	you	have	to	find	a	methodology	that
you	are	comfortable	trading.

**3.	You	May	Have	to	Change	Your	Method	Before	You	Find	the	Right	One**
Richard	 Bargh	 started	 out	 as	 a	 technical	 trader,	 switched	 to	 a	 fundamental
approach,	 and	 ultimately	 discovered	 that	 combining	 his	 fundamental	 analysis
with	technical	input	worked	best.	If	Parker	didn’t	have	the	flexibility	to	radically
alter	 his	 trading	 approach—even	 to	 the	 extent	 of	 switching	 from	 momentum
systems	to	their	exact	opposite,	mean-reversion	systems—he	would	never	have
survived,	let	alone	continued	to	profit,	as	a	trader.
**4.	Keep	a	Trading	Journal**
Maintaining	a	trading	journal	is	one	of	the	most	effective	tools	a	trader	can	use
to	improve.	A	trading	journal	can	provide	two	critical	types	of	information:	what
the	 trader	 is	 doing	 right	 and	 what	 the	 trader	 is	 doing	 wrong.	 Several	 of	 the
traders	 interviewed	 (Bargh,	 Sall,	 Dhaliwal)	 emphasized	 the	 critical	 role	 of
keeping	 a	 detailed	 trading	 journal	 in	 their	 improvement	 as	 traders.	 Besides
documenting	the	reasons	for	trades	and	associated	right	and	wrong	decisions,	a
journal	 can	 also	 be	 useful	 in	 recording	 emotional	 observations.	 For	 example,
Bargh	 records	 his	 thoughts	 and	 feelings	 daily	 to	 identify	 weaknesses	 in	 his
mindset	and	to	track	how	his	mindset	changes	over	time.
**5.	Categorize	Trades**
Categorizing	trades	by	type	can	be	extremely	useful	in	determining	what	works
and	 what	 doesn’t.	 Although	 systematic	 traders	 can	 test	 defined	 trade	 types
retrospectively,	discretionary	traders	must	record	the	trade	type	and	outcome	as
they	occur.	One	thing	Brandt	regrets	is	that	he	didn’t	keep	track	of	results	by
types	of	trade.	For	example,	he	believes	that	trades	that	were	not	on	his	weekly
monitor	list	were	poor	performers	on	balance,	but	he	really	doesn’t	know	if	that
assumption	is	true.
**6.	Know	Your	Edge**
If	you	don’t	know	what	your	edge	is,	you	don’t	have	one.	Knowing	your	edge	is
critical	to	identifying	which	trades	to	focus	on.	For	example,	with	the	aid	of	his
detailed	trading	journal,	Dhaliwal	was	able	to	study	the	characteristics	of	his	big


wins.	 He	 discovered	 these	 trades	 shared	 multiple	 common	 denominators:	 the
presence	of	an	unexpected	market	event,	harmony	between	his	short-term	and
long-term	 views,	 and	 a	 tendency	 for	 the	 trade	 to	 work	 immediately.	 An
awareness	of	the	type	of	trades	that	accounted	for	the	bulk	of	his	gains—that	is,
understanding	 his	 edge—was	 an	 essential	 component	 of	 Dhaliwal’s	 stellar
performance.	As	Dhaliwal	advises,	“Stay	in	the	sphere	of	your	edge	by	playing
your	game	and	not	someone	else’s.”

**7.	Learn	from	Your	Mistakes**
Learning	 from	 mistakes	 is	 how	 traders	 improve.	 Perhaps	 the	 most	 valuable
benefit	 of	 a	 trading	 journal	 is	 that	 it	 greatly	 facilitates	 the	 identification	 of
trading	errors.	Reviewing	such	a	journal	periodically	can	remind	the	trader	of
past	mistakes	and,	in	so	doing,	reduce	the	repetition	of	the	same	mistakes.	Sall
used	his	journal	to	identify	a	mistake	he	was	making	after	winning	periods.	He
noticed	 that	 he	 was	 continually	 taking	 subpar	 trades	 after	 highly	 profitable
periods.	 He	 realized	 that	 because	 he	 came	 from	 a	 working-class	 background,
these	subpar	 trades	were	 an	 act	of	 self-sabotage	to	 bring	 him	“back	 down	 to
earth.”	Once	he	recognized	the	problem,	he	was	able	to	avoid	repeating	it.

As	another	example	of	a	trader	identifying	a	mistake	through	his	trading	journal,
Dhaliwal	noticed	that	emotional	disharmony	he	was	feeling	could	be	traced	to
trades	 where	 he	 had	 a	 conflict	 between	 his	 short-term	 and	 long-term	 views.
When	he	had	a	longer-term	trade	on	but	saw	an	opportunity	for	a	short-term
trade	 in	 the	 opposite	 direction,	 Dhaliwal	 would	 end	 up	 trading	 neither	 view
effectively.	Once	he	recognized	the	source	of	his	trading	error,	he	solved	the
problem	by	separating	the	two	conflicting	trades.	He	would	leave	the	long-term
trade	on,	and	then	trade	the	short-term	opportunity	separately.

**8.	The	Power	of	Asymmetric	Strategies**
Most	of	the	traders	interviewed	had	track	records	characterized	by	large	gains
being	far	more	frequent	and	much	larger—sometimes	tremendously	greater—
than	large	losses.	These	traders	achieved	their	positively	skewed	return	profiles
by	 utilizing	 asymmetric	 trading	 strategies.	 The	 King	 of	 Asymmetry	 is	 Amrit
Sall,	who	had	34	days	with	returns	greater	than	15%	(three	greater	than	100%)
and	 only	 one	 day	 with	 a	 double-digit	 loss	 (and	 that	 loss	 was	 caused	 by	 a
computer	glitch).	Sall	will	wait	for	trades	tied	to	events	where	he	expects	an
immediate,	 significant	 price	 move	 and	 will	 exit	 the	 trade	 quickly	 if	 the
anticipated	market	response	fails	to	materialize.	The	average	win	on	these	trades
will	be	far	greater	than	the	average	loss.

As	another	example,	Neumann	focuses	on	identifying	trading	opportunities	that


have	the	potential	to	be	what	Peter	Lynch	termed	“ten	baggers”—investments
that	achieve	a	tenfold	price	increase.	He	uses	trendline	breakouts	to	enter	the
trade	and	will	liquidate	immediately	if	the	stock	price	fails	to	follow	through.

**9.	Risk	Management	Is	Critical**
I	don’t	care	how	many	times	you’ve	heard	it,	but	when	virtually	every	successful
trader	stresses	how	critical	money	management	is,	you	better	pay	attention.	Sure,
money	management	is	not	as	sexy	as	devising	trade	entry	strategies,	but	it	is
essential	to	survival,	let	alone	excelling.	Several	elements	of	risk	management
came	up	in	the	interviews:

```
Individual	 position	 risk	 controls —It	 is	 striking	 how	 many	 of	 the
interviewed	 traders	 experienced	 their	 worst	 loss	 due	 to	 the	 lack	 of	 a
protective	stop.	Dhaliwal’s	biggest	loss—the	trade	he	took	in	response	to	an
erroneous	 FT 	story—was	as	large	as	it	was	because	he	didn’t	have	a	stop.
Sall’s	worst	loss,	which	occurred	when	his	PC	suddenly	powered	down	at	a
critical	 moment,	 was	 also	 due	 to	 not	 having	 a	 stop.	 Kean	 learned	 the
importance	of	limiting	the	risk	on	individual	trades	early	in	his	career	when
he	shorted	a	stock	in	a	parabolic	upmove	without	a	plan	on	what	to	do	if	he
was	 wrong.	 The	 stock	 price	 nearly	 doubled	 on	 him	 in	 a	 matter	 of	 days,
resulting	 in	 a	 10%	 hit	 to	 his	 portfolio—his	 worst	 loss	 ever.	 In	 all	 three
cases,	these	experiences	led	the	traders	to	use	stops	religiously.	They	never
made	 the	 same	 mistake	 again.	 As	 another	 example	 of	 a	 trader
transformation	regarding	risk	control,	Shapiro	went	from	blowing	up	plus-
half-million-dollar	 accounts	 twice	 to	 never	 entering	 a	 trade	 without	 a
predetermined	exit.
Risk	management	at	the	portfolio	level —Limiting	the	loss	on	individual
trades	is	critical,	but	it	is	not	sufficient	for	adequate	risk	control.	Traders
also	 need	 to	 be	 concerned	 about	 correlation	 between	 their	 positions.	 If
different	positions	are	significantly	correlated,	then	the	portfolio	risk	may
be	unacceptably	high,	even	if	every	position	has	stop	protection,	because
different	 trades	 will	 tend	 to	 lose	 money	 together.	 Shapiro	 handles	 the
problem	of	an	excess	of	correlated	positions	in	two	ways:	He	reduces	the
sizes	of	individual	positions,	and	he	seeks	to	add	trades	that	are	inversely
correlated	to	the	existing	portfolio.
The	 concept	 of	 building	 a	 portfolio	 of	 uncorrelated	 and	 inversely
correlated	positions	also	lies	at	the	heart	of	Kean’s	trading	philosophy.
```

```
Any	 long-only	 equity	 portfolio	 faces	 the	 problem	 that	 most	 of	 the
positions	 will	 be	 highly	 correlated.	 Approximately	 60%	 of	 Kean’s
portfolio	consists	of	a	long	equity	component,	which,	by	definition,
will	contain	positions	that	are	highly	correlated	with	each	other.	Kean
addresses	this	problem	by	combining	this	portion	of	his	portfolio	with
a	trading	strategy	that	is,	on	balance,	inversely	correlated	with	long
equities	because	the	majority	of	these	trades	are	shorts.
Equity-based	risk	management —Even	when	risk	management	is	applied
at	both	the	individual	position	and	portfolio	levels,	equity	drawdowns	can
still	 exceed	 acceptable	 levels.	 Equity-based	 risk	 controls	 will	 either	 cut
position	 sizes	 or	 cease	 trading	 altogether	 when	 equity	 drawdowns	 reach
specific	threshold	levels.	For	example,	Dhaliwal	will	cut	his	position	size	in
half	if	a	drawdown	exceeds	5%,	and	cut	it	by	half	again	if	a	drawdown
exceeds	 8%.	 If	 a	 drawdown	 reaches	 15%,	 Dhaliwal	 will	 stop	 trading
altogether	until	he	feels	ready	to	resume	trading.
Equity-based	risk	controls	can	also	be	applied	in	dollar	terms	rather
than	percentage	terms.	Although	the	two	are	equivalent,	a	dollar-based
risk	 point	 may	 be	 a	 more	 useful	 conceptualization,	 especially	 when
starting	 to	 trade	 a	 new	 account.	 A	 risk	 control	 I	 recommend	 when
starting	a	new	trading	account	is	to	decide	how	much	you	are	willing
to	lose	before	you	stop	trading.	For	example,	if	you	open	a	$100,000
account,	you	might	decide	you	are	willing	to	risk	$15,000	before	you
liquidate	all	positions	and	stop	trading.	There	are	three	reasons	why
this	type	of	risk	action	makes	sense:
```
(^1) .	If	you	reach	your	account	risk	point,	it	means	whatever	you	are	doing
is	 not	 working.	 So	 stopping	 trading	 and	 reevaluating	 your
methodology	makes	sense.
2 .	If	you	are	in	a	losing	streak,	taking	a	trading	break	and	starting	fresh
when	you	feel	ready	and	inspired	to	do	so	will	usually	be	beneficial.
3 .	Perhaps	most	importantly,	determining	how	much	you	are	willing	to
lose	before	you	start	trading	will	keep	you	from	losing	all	your	risk
capital	in	one	failed	attempt.	This	approach	is	also	powerful	because,
at	its	core,	it	is	an	asymmetric	strategy	(the	advantages	of	which	were
discussed	in	#8):	You	can	lose	only	the	dollar	amount	you	set	as	your
risk	cutout	level,	but	your	upside	is	entirely	open-ended.

**10.	Choose	Meaningful	Stop	Points**


Dhaliwal	makes	the	critical	point	that	protective	stops	should	be	placed	at	a	level
that	disproves	your	trade	hypothesis.	Don’t	determine	the	stop	by	what	you	are
willing	to	lose.	If	a	meaningful	stop	point	implies	too	much	risk,	it	means	that
your	position	is	too	large.	Reduce	the	position	size	so	that	you	can	place	the	stop
at	a	price	the	market	shouldn’t	go	to	if	your	trade	idea	is	correct,	while	still
restricting	 the	 implied	 loss	 at	 that	 stop	 point	 to	 an	 amount	 within	 your	 risk
tolerance	on	the	trade.

**11.	You	Don’t	Have	to	Wait	for	a	Stop	to	Be	Hit**
A	stop	is	intended	to	limit	your	approximate	maximum	loss	on	a	trade	to	some
predetermined	amount.	However,	as	Bargh	advises,	you	don’t	need	to	wait	for	a
stop	to	be	hit.	The	longer	a	trade	has	an	open	loss,	the	more	seriously	you	should
consider	liquidation	even	though	the	stop	point	hasn’t	been	hit.	Bargh	believes
that	the	money	saved	exiting	such	trades	before	the	stop	point	is	reached	will
exceed	the	forgone	profits	on	the	trades	that	recover.
**12.	Brandt’s	Friday	Close	Rule**
Brandt	will	liquidate	any	trade	that	is	showing	an	open	loss	as	of	Friday’s	close.
This	 rule	 is	 a	 specific	 example	 of	 the	 application	 of	 Bargh’s	 concept	 of	 not
waiting	for	stops	to	be	hit	on	lagging	trades	(#11).	Brandt’s	reasoning	is	that	the
Friday	close	is	the	most	critical	price	of	the	week	because	it	is	the	price	at	which
all	 holders	 of	 positions	 commit	 to	 the	 risk	 of	 holding	 a	 position	 over	 the
weekend.	Brandt	believes	that	an	open	loss	on	a	position	as	of	the	Friday	close
has	negative	implications	for	the	trade.	Traders	may	wish	to	experiment	applying
(or	tracking)	Brandt’s	rule	to	see	whether,	on	balance,	the	reduction	of	losses	on
affected	trades	exceeds	forgone	profits.
**13.	Don’t	Speculate	with	a	Loss**
Brandt’s	worst	loss	occurred	when	he	was	long	crude	oil	at	the	start	of	the	First
Gulf	 War,	 and	 the	 market	 opened	 far	 below	 his	 intended	 stop	 point	 the	 next
morning.	 When	 I	 asked	 him	 whether	 he	 might	 delay	 his	 exit	 in	 such
circumstances,	he	replied,	“If	you	speculate	with	a	loss	to	get	less	of	a	loss,	you
end	up	with	more	of	a	loss.”	That	indeed	proved	to	be	the	case	for	this	trade,	as
the	 market	 continued	 to	 sink	 further.	 I	 also	 have	 no	 doubt	 that	 Brandt’s
admonition	is	good	advice	in	general.
**14.	Winning	Traders	Have	a	Specific	Methodology**
Good	trading	is	the	antithesis	of	a	shoot-from-the-hip	approach.	All	the	traders
interviewed	had	a	precise	methodology.	Your	methodology	should	be	based	on
exploiting	trades	that	benefit	from	your	edge	(#6)	combined	with	appropriate
risk	management	(#9).


**15.	Stick	to	Trades	Defined	by	Your	Methodology**
It	is	common	for	traders	to	be	tempted	to	take	trades	that	are	entirely	outside
their	 sphere	 of	 expertise.	 One	 such	 example	 occurred	 when	 Kean	 let	 his
discipline	lapse.	One	year	when	he	was	well	ahead	with	only	a	month	to	go,
Kean	took	a	flier	buying	a	group	of	energy-related	stocks	simply	because	the
sector	 was	 down	 sharply.	 The	 trade	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 his	 standard
methodology.	This	impulsive	trade	cost	him	7%	by	the	time	he	liquidated	two
weeks	later.	Avoid	the	temptation	to	take	trades	unrelated	to	your	methodology.
**16.	Your	Methodology	May	Need	to	Change**
Markets	 change.	 Over	 time,	 even	 an	 effective	 methodology	 may	 need	 to	 be
altered.	 For	 example,	 in	 his	 early	 years,	 Dhaliwal’s	 most	 effective	 trading
strategy	was	rapid	entry	in	the	direction	of	news	headlines,	seeking	to	capture
the	initial	market	reaction	to	the	news.	However,	the	development	of	algorithmic
programs	that	could	execute	such	trades	faster	than	any	human	eventually	made
Dhaliwal’s	strategy	unviable.	He	adapted	his	strategy	to	do	virtually	the	opposite
trade:	fade	the	initial	reactions	to	headlines.	As	his	career	progressed,	he	focused
on	in-depth	fundamental	research	and	longer-term	trades.

Brandt	is	another	example	of	a	trader	who	had	to	modify	his	strategy.	His	trade
entry	 was	 based	 on	 classical	 chart	 analysis	 patterns.	 However,	 many	 of	 the
patterns	 that	 were	 once	 reliable	 ceased	 to	 be	 so.	 Brandt	 responded	 by
significantly	reducing	the	number	of	chart	patterns	he	used	for	entry	signals.

**17.	If	You	Are	Uncomfortable	with	an	Aspect	of	Your	Methodology,	Then	Change	It**
If	there	is	anything	in	your	approach	that	is	uncomfortable,	you	need	to	figure
out	 how	 to	 change	 it.	 For	 example,	 Bargh	 felt	 unease	 with	 his	 exit	 strategy
because	there	were	instances	when	he	would	give	back	a	substantial	portion	of
large	open	profits	on	a	trade.	This	sense	of	discomfort	led	Bargh	to	change	his
exit	strategy	in	a	way	that	avoided	this	problem.
**18.	How	a	Trade	Idea	Is	Implemented	Is	Critical**
One	of	Bargh’s	biggest	winning	trades	ever	was	a	bet	that	the	Brexit	vote	would
pass.	The	obvious	trade	that	would	profit	from	a	surprise	approval	of	the	Brexit
referendum	was	a	short	in	the	British	pound.	The	problem	with	this	direct	way	of
expressing	 a	 bet	 on	 the	 passage	 of	 Brexit	 was	 that	 the	 British	 pound	 was
swinging	 wildly	 as	 vote	 results	 came	 in	 for	 each	 region.	 The	 direct	 trade	 of
shorting	the	British	pound	risked	getting	stopped	out	at	a	substantial	loss	if	the
timing	of	the	trade	was	slightly	off.

Bargh	reasoned	that	if	the	Brexit	vote	passed,	there	would	be	a	shift	in	market
psychology	to	risk-off	trades,	such	as	long	T-bonds.	The	advantage	of	long	T-


bonds	versus	short	British	pounds	was	that	T-bonds	were	far	less	volatile,	and
hence	the	trade	was	less	likely	to	get	stopped	out	if	correct,	and	would	lose	less
if	 wrong.	 The	 indirect	 long	 T-bond	 position	 provided	 a	 far	 better	 return/risk
position	 for	 expressing	 the	 trade	 idea.	 The	 lesson	 is	 that	 the	 direct	 way	 of
implementing	a	market	idea	is	not	always	the	best	approach.

**19.	Take	Larger	Positions	on	High-Conviction	Trades**
Don’t	take	the	same	size	position	or	risk	on	every	trade.	Taking	much	larger
positions	 on	 high-conviction	 trades	 is	 an	 essential	 factor	 underlying	 the
incredibly	outsized	returns	achieved	by	some	of	the	traders	in	this	book.	Sall,	for
example,	will	be	aggressive	in	his	position	sizing	for	trades	that	he	perceives
combine	large	positive	asymmetry	with	a	high	probability	of	success.	Neumann
steps	on	the	gas	when	he	has	a	particularly	high	conviction	on	a	trade.	In	the
case	of	AunthenTek,	he	had	over	one-third	of	his	entire	account	in	this	single
position.

To	be	clear,	what	is	being	advised	is	taking	larger	positions	on	high-conviction
trades,	not	taking	the	huge	positions	(relative	to	equity)	that	traders	such	as	Sall
and	 Neumann	 will	 place	 when	 they	 see	 especially	 attractive	 market
opportunities.	Sall	and	Neumann	are	exceptionally	skilled	traders	who	have	a
high	 success	 rate	 on	 their	 strong-conviction	 trades	 and	 are	 quick	 to	 liquidate
when	a	trade	starts	to	move	against	them.	For	most	ordinary	traders,	taking	huge
positions,	no	matter	how	high	their	conviction	level,	is	a	risky	proposition.

**20.	Don’t	Trade	So	Large	that	Fear	Becomes	a	Dominant	Factor**
If	you	trade	too	large,	fear	will	lead	to	poor	trading	decisions.	In	his	early	trading
years,	Bargh	felt	that	he	should	be	trading	position	size	levels	that	exceeded	his
comfort	level.	As	a	consequence,	he	passed	up	many	good	trading	opportunities.
There	is	no	contradiction	between	the	advice	here	and	the	advice	offered	in	the
previous	 entry,	 which	 merely	 advised	 taking	 larger-than-normal	 positions	 on
high-conviction	trades.	Even	in	that	instance,	the	position	should	not	be	so	large
that	fear	interferes	with	the	trade	decision	process.
**21.	If	You	Hope	a	Trade	Will	Work,	Get	Out**
If	you	find	yourself	hoping	your	trade	will	work,	that	is	a	sure	sign	that	you	lack
conviction.	Early	in	his	career,	when	Sall	was	taking	trades	based	on	technical
signals,	he	found	himself	hoping	trades	would	work.	His	unease	with	this	feeling
convinced	him	that	technical	trading	was	the	wrong	approach	for	him.

In	another	instance,	Sall	placed	maximum	positions	in	three	highly	correlated
markets	on	a	marginal	trade	idea.	When	the	risk	manager	queried	him	as	to	what
he	was	doing,	Sall	suddenly	realized	that	he	was	 _hoping	_ his	triple-size	position


would	work.	Recalling	this	experience,	Sall	said,	“The	second	I	realized	that	I
was	hoping	and	not	trading	anymore,	I	immediately	liquidated	everything.”

If	you	are	hoping	a	trade	will	work,	you	are	gambling	and	not	trading.

**22.	Don’t	Trade	Based	on	Someone	Else’s	Recommendations**
You	 need	 to	 trade	 based	 on	 your	 own	 methodology	 and	 your	 own	 decisions.
Trades	based	on	someone	else’s	recommendation	tend	to	end	badly,	even	when
the	advice	is	correct.	For	example,	Brandt	lost	money	on	a	trade	recommended
by	 a	 floor	 trader	 for	 whom	 the	 trade	 worked	 very	 well.	 Brandt	 failed	 to
appreciate	the	difference	in	holding	periods	between	himself	and	the	floor	trader.
Camillo’s	 most	 regretful	 trade	 was	 when	 he	 liquidated	 two-thirds	 of	 what
ultimately	proved	to	be	an	excellent	position	at	a	loss	because	he	was	influenced
by	conflicting	market	opinions.
**23.	Distinguish	Between	Trade	Outcomes	and	Trade	Decisions**
Many	traders	erroneously	evaluate	their	trading	based	solely	on	outcomes.	When
asked	to	recount	his	worst	trade,	ironically,	Bargh	immediately	described	a	dual-
position	trade	that	resulted	in	only	a	small	loss.	In	this	particular	trade,	Bargh
experienced	 a	 quick,	 large	 loss	 but	 couldn’t	 bring	 himself	 to	 liquidate	 the
positions.	 He	 hesitated,	 and	 the	 trade	 partially	 recovered.	 Bargh	 used	 this
pullback	as	an	opportunity	to	liquidate	his	positions,	exiting	at	only	a	moderate
loss.	Just	after	he	liquidated,	the	market	then	moved	violently	against	his	original
positions.	Although	Bargh’s	initial	inability	to	exit	the	losing	trade	worked	to	his
benefit,	he	realized	that	he	had	made	an	enormous	trading	error	but	had	just	been
lucky.	If	the	market	hadn’t	experienced	its	short-lived	pullback,	his	initial	large
loss	could	have	turned	into	a	disastrous	one.

Bargh	was	able	to	distinguish	between	the	outcome—a	smaller	loss—and	the
decision—an	inability	to	act	that	could	have	resulted	in	an	account-threatening
loss.	The	point	is	that	sometimes	winning	trades	(or	smaller	losing	ones,	as	was
the	case	here)	may	be	bad	trades.	Similarly,	losing	trades	could	be	good	trades	if
the	 trader	 adhered	 to	 a	 methodology	 that,	 on	 balance,	 is	 profitable	 with
reasonable	risk	control.

**24.	The	Return/Risk	Ratio	of	a	Trade	Is	Dynamic**
Dhaliwal	makes	the	point	that	trades	are	dynamic,	and	traders	need	to	adjust
their	exit	strategy	accordingly.	If	a	trader	establishes	both	a	profit	target	and	a
stop	when	a	trade	is	initiated,	and	the	trade	moves	80%	of	the	way	towards	the
target,	the	return/risk	at	that	point	will	be	very	different	from	what	it	was	when
the	trade	was	implemented.	In	such	a	situation,	the	original	exit	plan	no	longer
makes	sense.	If	a	trade	moves	significantly	in	your	favor,	consider	tightening


your	stop,	or	taking	partial	profits,	or	both.

Brandt	calls	trades	in	which	you	have	a	profit	and	ride	it	all	the	way	back	to
where	you	got	in	“popcorn	trades.”	He	avoids	popcorn	trades	by	a	combination
of	taking	profits	and	tightening	stops—an	approach	that	recognizes	and	responds
to	the	dynamic	nature	of	trades.

**25.	Human	Emotions	Are	Detrimental	to	Trading**
Human	emotions	and	impulses	will	often	lead	traders	to	do	the	wrong	thing.	As
Brandt	said,	“I	am	my	own	worst	enemy.”	The	next	three	sections	detail	different
categories	of	emotion-based	actions	that	adversely	impact	trading.
**26.	Guard	Against	Impulsive	Trades**
Impulsive	trades	are,	by	definition,	emotional	trades,	and	emotional	trades	tend
to	 be	 losers.	 Beware	 of	 being	 enamored	 by	 an	 unplanned	 trade.	 Neumann’s
biggest	 loss	 (in	 percentage	 terms)	 came	 early	 in	 his	 career	 when	 he	 deviated
from	a	strategy	that	was	generating	consistent	returns	to	impulsively	buy	a	stock
that	was	rising	rapidly	based	on	a	bullish	story.	That	single	trade	resulted	in	a
30%	loss	in	one	day.
**27.	Trades	Motivated	by	Greed	Usually	End	Badly**
Greed	will	cause	traders	to	take	marginal	trades,	or	place	positions	that	are	too
large,	or	both.	Bargh’s	worst	trading	loss	was	a	consequence	of	greed.	In	this
particular	instance,	he	initially	took	a	large	short	position	in	the	euro	based	on
comments	Mario	Draghi	made	at	a	press	conference.	This	initial	position	was
entirely	consistent	with	Bargh’s	methodology.	However,	Bargh	then	took	a	large
long	position	in	the	Bund—a	position	highly	correlated	to	his	original	trade,	but
one	 that	 had	 no	 justification,	 since	 Draghi’s	 comments	 only	 pertained	 to	 the
euro.	Bargh	admits	that	the	doubling	of	his	exposure	by	buying	the	Bund	was
entirely	influenced	by	greed.	Both	positions	then	turned	against	Bargh.	By	the
time	he	liquidated,	Bargh	was	down	12%	for	the	day—his	worst	daily	loss	ever
—with	most	of	the	loss	coming	from	the	impulsively	added	long	Bund	position.

Traders	need	to	be	aware	when	a	trade	they	are	about	to	take	is	motivated	by
greed	rather	than	an	application	of	their	methodology.	Such	trades	will	usually
end	badly.

**28.	Beware	of	a	Compulsion	to	Make	Money	Back	in	the	Same	Market**
When	 traders,	 particularly	 novice	 traders,	 lose	 money	 in	 a	 market,	 there	 is	 a
reflexive	 instinct	 to	 try	 to	 make	 it	 back	 in	 the	 same	 market.	 This	 impulse,
perhaps	driven	by	a	desire	to	seek	revenge	or	to	expiate	the	prior	trading	loss,
leads	 to	 emotion-induced	 trading,	 and	 emotion-based	 trades	 are	 particularly
prone	to	bad	outcomes.


John	 Netto’s	 experience	 on	 March	 17,	 2003,	 when	 President	 Bush	 issued	 an
ultimatum	to	Saddam	Hussein	to	leave	Iraq,	provides	a	classic	example	of	the
danger	of	trying	to	recover	a	loss	in	the	same	market.	Initially,	Netto	went	short
the	S&P	500	when	it	opened	lower	that	day,	anticipating	a	further	slide.	The
market	abruptly	reversed,	stopping	Netto	out	at	a	large,	single-trade	loss.	Had	he
stopped	there,	it	would	just	have	been	an	ordinary	bad	day.	But,	like	a	dog	with	a
bone,	Netto	kept	shorting	the	market.	By	the	end	of	the	day,	he	had	gone	short
and	been	stopped	out	five	times,	nearly	quintupling	his	original	loss	and	wiping
out	his	profits	for	the	year.

**29.	The	Real	Damage	of	a	Bad	Trade**
Many	traders	fail	to	realize	that	the	greatest	damage	from	a	bad	trade	is	often	not
the	loss	on	the	trade	itself	but,	rather,	the	lost	profits	on	subsequent	good	trades
not	 taken	 because	 of	 the	 destabilizing	 effect	 of	 the	 bad	 trade.	 The	 day	 after
Bargh	experienced	his	worst	loss	due	to	the	greed-induced	trade	detailed	in	#27,
the	Bank	of	England	switched	to	a	hiking	bias.	It	was	precisely	the	type	of	event
that	provides	Bargh	with	his	best	profit	opportunities.	However,	Bargh	was	still
too	shaken	up	by	his	12%	loss	the	day	before	to	pull	the	trigger	on	that	trade.
The	market	had	the	big	move	Bargh	anticipated,	but	he	was	not	in	the	trade.	The
lesson	is	that	the	cost	of	a	trading	mistake	often	substantially	exceeds	the	direct
loss	on	the	trade	taken—all	the	more	reason	to	avoid	trading	mistakes	(losses
due	to	traders	breaking	their	own	rules).
**30.	Don’t	Exit	the	Entire	Position	at	the	Profit	Target**
Frequently,	market	price	moves	will	continue	to	extend	well	beyond	a	trader’s
profit	target.	Therefore,	instead	of	liquidating	an	entire	position	at	a	profit	target,
traders	should	consider	holding	onto	a	minor	portion	of	the	position	with	raised
protective	stops.	In	this	way,	they	maintain	the	opportunity	to	profit	significantly
further	if	there	is	a	longer-term	move	in	the	direction	of	the	trade,	while	risking
only	a	small	surrender	of	profits	if	the	market	reverses.

For	example,	Bargh	will	take	profits	when	the	market	reaches	his	price	target.
However,	after	locking	in	his	profits	in	the	trade,	he	will	routinely	maintain	5%–
10%	of	the	position,	which	he	may	hold	for	a	longer-term	price	move.	In	this
way,	he	can	add	a	few	percent	profit	to	a	trade	with	minimal	risk.

**31.	If	You	Are	on	the	Right	Side	of	Euphoria	or	Panic,	Liquidate	or	Lighten	Up**
Parabolic	price	moves	in	either	direction	tend	to	end	abruptly	and	sharply.	If	you
are	on	the	right	side	of	such	a	trade,	consider	taking	partial	or	total	profits,	while
the	 market	 is	 moving	 near-vertically	 in	 your	 favor.	 Neumann’s	 exit	 of	 his
Spongetech	trade	provides	a	perfect	illustration	of	this	principle.


**32.	Guard	Against	Complacency	and	Sloppy	Trading	after	Big	Winning	Streaks**
Traders	often	experience	their	worst	performance	after	periods	when	they	have
done	exceptionally	well.	Why?	Because	winning	streaks	lead	to	complacency,
and	complacency	leads	to	sloppy	trading.	When	their	accounts	are	sailing	to	new
highs	almost	daily,	and	virtually	all	their	trades	are	working,	traders	will	tend	to
become	 less	 diligent	 in	 executing	 their	 methodology	 and	 laxer	 in	 their	 risk
management.	Several	of	the	traders	interviewed	had	this	precise	experience	of
worst	performance	following	best	performance:

```
Brandt’s	 first	 losing	 year	 after	 becoming	 a	 full-time	 trader	 occurred
immediately	following	his	best	trading	year	ever.
After	a	great	first	six	months	of	trading,	Sall	fell	into	the	complacency	trap.
In	his	own	words:	“I	got	cocky	and	relaxed	with	my	discipline.”	During	this
time,	 he	 placed	 limit	 positions	 in	 three	 highly	 correlated	 markets	 on	 a
marginal	trade—an	action	that	could	have	resulted	in	a	huge	loss	were	it	not
for	the	firm’s	risk	manager’s	quick	intervention.
When	I	asked	Bargh	about	his	underperformance	during	the	first	half	of
2018,	he	explained,	“I	had	a	very	good	2017	and	came	into	2018	with	the
mindset	that	I	could	push	it.	I	was	taking	too	much	risk.”
```
The	moral	is:	If	everything	is	going	great,	watch	out!

**33.	The	Flexibility	to	Change	Your	Opinion	Is	an	Attribute,	Not	a	Flaw**
I	find	it	ironic	that	some	of	Brandt’s	Twitter	followers	criticize	him	for	changing
his	market	opinion—something	he	frequently	does.	That	is	such	a	wrong-headed
perspective.	 The	 flexibility	 to	 change	 your	 market	 view	 is	 essential	 to
succeeding	as	a	trader.	If	you	are	rigid	in	your	market	stance,	you	only	need	to
be	wrong	once	to	decimate	your	account.	Brandt’s	motto	is:	“strong	opinions,
weakly	held.”	The	implication	is	that	you	should	have	firm	conviction	when	you
enter	a	trade,	but	you	should	be	quick	to	abandon	that	position	if	the	trade	moves
against	you.
**34.	Missed	Trades	Can	Be	More	Painful—and	More	Expensive—than	Trading	Losses**
Missing	a	large	profit	opportunity	can	impact	your	trading	profitability	as	much
as	 multiple	 trading	 losses.	 And	 such	 a	 missed	 opportunity	 can	 be	 even	 more
painful	than	a	trading	loss.	Bargh	missed	a	massive	profit	opportunity	because	he
ran	a	bank	errand	during	trading	hours.	One	primary	cause	of	missed	trades	is
the	destabilizing	impact	of	bad	trades	(see	#29).
**35.	What	to	Do	When	You	Are	Out	of	Sync	with	the	Markets**


When	you	are	in	a	losing	streak,	and	everything	you	do	seems	wrong,	the	best
action	may	be	to	stop	trading	temporarily.	Losses	beget	losses.	Taking	a	break
can	 act	 as	 a	 circuit	 breaker.	 Bargh	 says	 that	 when	 he	 feels	 destabilized	 by	 a
trading	experience,	he	will	“take	some	time	off,	exercise,	go	out	in	nature,	have
fun.”

Brandt	has	another	answer	about	what	to	do	when	you	are	out	of	sync	with	the
markets.	He	cuts	his	trading	size—an	action	that	will	mitigate	the	drawdown
during	a	negative	period.

Dhaliwal’s	 method	 of	 handling	 losing	 periods	 combines	 both	 the	 above
approaches.	If	he	is	in	a	drawdown	that	exceeds	5%,	he	will	cut	his	position	in
half.	If	the	drawdown	exceeds	8%,	he	will	cut	the	position	in	half	again.	If	the
drawdown	reaches	15%,	he	will	take	a	complete	break	from	trading.

The	underlying	concept	in	all	the	above	approaches	is	that	if	you	are	in	a	losing
streak,	you	need	to	cut	risk—either	by	stopping	trading	altogether	or	by	reducing
position	size.

**36.	Counter-to-Expected	Market	Reactions	to	News**
A	 counter-to-expected	 market	 response	 to	 news	 can	 be	 a	 very	 valuable	 trade
signal.	 This	 concept	 came	 up	 repeatedly	 in	 the	 trader	 interviews.	 Some
examples:

```
Dhaliwal recounted	a	short	Australian	dollar	trade	where	his	fundamental
view	coincided	with	a	downside	chart	breakout.	An	unemployment	report
was	released	that	day,	and	all	the	statistics	were	extremely	bullish.	Initially,
the	market	rallied	as	expected.	But	then	the	rally	fizzled,	and	prices	moved
below	the	low	of	a	long-term	trading	range.	The	combination	of	a	highly
bullish	report	and	a	very	bearish	market	response	convinced	Dhaliwal	that
the	market	would	move	sharply	lower,	which	it	did.
Brandt’s	 worst	 loss	 occurred	 in	 one	 of	 the	 most	 extreme	 examples	 of	 a
counter-to-expected	market	response.	Brandt	was	long	crude	oil	at	the	start
of	the	First	Gulf	War	with	the	news	of	the	war’s	beginning	hitting	after	the
market	close.	Crude	traded	$2–$3	higher	that	night	on	the	Kerb	(an	after-
hours	market	in	London).	But	the	next	morning,	crude	oil	opened	$7	below
the	New	York	close—a	$10	swing	from	its	nighttime	levels.	This	extreme
bearish	response	to	bullish	news	served	as	a	longer-term	bearish	signal.
Netto’s	repeated	losses	in	selling	the	S&P	500	on	the	day President	Bush
issued	an	ultimatum	to	Saddam	Hussein	to	step	down	(detailed	in	#28)	were
```

```
a	consequence	of	his	failure	to	recognize	the	significance	of	the	market’s
counter-to-expected	response	to	the	news.
Kean	ignored	classic	counter-to-expected	price	action	in	his	largest	holding,
JD.com.	After	an	announcement	of	a	deal	with	Google,	JD.com	initially
rallied	but	then	reversed,	closing	sharply	lower.	Kean	held	onto	his	position
despite	this	ominous	price	action,	and	the	stock	lost	more	than	half	its	value
in	the	ensuing	months.	Commenting	on	this	experience,	Kean	said,	“The
worst	mistake	was	ignoring	that	day’s	price	action.	As	someone	who	trades
for	a	living,	I	should	have	known	better.”
On	election	night	2016,	as	the	returns	started	indicating	a	surprise	Trump
victory,	 stock	 indexes	 sold	 off,	 as	 was	 anticipated	 in	 such	 an	 event.	 But
then,	 even	 though	 a	 Trump	 win	 became	 increasingly	 likely,	 the	 market
reversed	 sharply	 to	 the	 upside.	 This	 counter-to-expected	 price	 action
marked	the	start	of	a	14-month	steady	climb	in	stock	prices.
```
**37.	Being	Profitable	Versus	Being	Right**
Ego	and	the	need	to	be	right	are	detrimental	to	effective	trading.	Many	traders
are	more	invested	in	their	market	theories	and	prognostications	being	right	than
they	are	in	being	profitable,	which	is	all	that	matters.	As	Dhaliwal	succinctly	put
it,	“it’s	not	about	being	right;	it’s	about	making	money.”
**38.	Aiming	for	Consistent	Profitability	Can	Be	Counterproductive**
Consistent	profitability	may	sound	like	a	worthwhile	goal,	but	it	can	actually	be
counterproductive.	Trade	opportunities	are	sporadic,	and	aiming	for	consistent
profitability	in	low-opportunity	periods	can	lead	to	taking	marginal	trades	that
end	up	being	net	losers.	Although	Bargh	was	urged	by	his	bosses	to	strive	for
consistency,	he	resisted	this	advice,	sensing	it	was	incompatible	with	the	way	he
traded.	“I	never	really	thought	that	is	how	trading	worked,”	he	said.	“It’s	more
like	you	make	nothing	for	a	while,	then	you	have	a	spurt.”	As	a	strikingly	ironic
observation,	 Sall	 noted	 that	 a	 common	 trait	 he	 observed	 among	 traders	 who
failed	is	that	they	had	a	goal	of	making	money	every	month.
**39.	Be	Observant	and	Highly	Attuned	to	New	Behavioral	Trends**
Spotting	emerging	trends,	both	in	your	everyday	life	and	in	social	media,	can	be
a	source	for	uncovering	trading	opportunities.	Detecting	consumer	and	cultural
trends	 early	 is	 a	 critical	 component	 of	 the	 strategy	 employed	 by	 two	 of	 the
traders	 in	 this	 book:	 Camillo	 and	 Neumann.	 For	 example,	 Camillo	 identified
trades	 such	 as	 Cheesecake	 Factory	 and	 P.	 F.	 Chang’s	 by	 observing	 Middle
America’s	reaction	to	these	chains—a	response	he	knew	Wall	Street	would	be


blind	to.	Many	of	Neumann’s	best	trades	involved	catching	trends,	such	as	3D
printing	and	CBD	products,	early.

**40.	Trading	Systems	Sometimes	Stop	Working**
As	Parker	repeatedly	experienced	during	his	career,	systems	can	work	for	a	time
but	 then	 entirely	 lose	 their	 edge,	 or	 even	 become	 consistent	 net	 losers.	 This
inconvenient	 fact	 implies	 that	 the	 ability	 to	 terminate	 or	 radically	 change
systems	is	essential	to	longer-term	success	as	a	systematic	trader.	Parker	now
employs	 a	 system	 stop.	 He	 uses	 trend-following	 applied	 to	 a	 system’s	 equity
curve	to	signal	when	a	system	should	be	deactivated.	Specifically,	Parker	will
stop	trading	a	system	if	its	equity	curve	falls	below	its	200-day	moving	average.
**41.	Trading	for	a	Living	Is	Hard**
As	Brandt	notes,	“The	markets	are	not	an	annuity.”	As	one	indication	of	how
difficult	trading	for	a	living	is,	Parker	almost	quit	trading	in	early	2016,	only
eight	months	after	having	set	new	highs	in	cumulative	profits	and	despite	still
being	more	than	$5	million	ahead.	Aspirants	to	trading	for	a	living	need	to	keep
in	 mind	 that	 it	 is	 not	 sufficient	 for	 cumulative	 profits	 to	 continue	 rising.
Cumulative	profits	need	to	continually	increase	by	more	than	the	sum	of	taxes
and	cumulative	withdrawals	for	living	expenses.	Another	complicating	factor	is
that	 trading	 profitability	 is	 inherently	 sporadic,	 while	 living	 expenses	 are
continual.	In	recognition	of	these	real-life	considerations,	Parker	advises	those
seeking	to	trade	for	a	living	to	keep	their	day	job	as	long	as	feasible.
**42.	Work	Commitment**
Although	many	people	are	drawn	to	trading	because	they	think	it	is	an	easy	way
to	make	a	lot	of	money,	ironically,	traders	who	excel	tend	to	have	a	very	strong
work	commitment.	Krejčí	provides	a	good	example	of	this	strong	work	ethic.	To
develop	his	trading	methodology,	Krejčí	had	to	put	in	16-hour	days	between	his
day	job	and	market	research.	Krejčí’s	methodology	results	in	virtually	no	trading
opportunities	in	five	months	of	the	year.	Although	he	could	just	take	those	five
months	off,	he	will	still	devote	full-time	to	the	markets	in	those	months,	using
the	trading	downtime	to	continue	his	market	research.	As	another	example	(but
by	no	means	the	only	other	one),	Sall	believes	his	work	ethic	was	essential	to	his
success.	 He	 recalls	 putting	 in	 15-	 to	 18-hour	 days	 in	 his	 early	 years.	 “I	 am
willing	to	outwork	everyone	else,”	he	says.
**43.	Take	Responsibility	for	Your	Own	Results**
Krejčí	chose	trading	as	a	career	path	because	he	sought	an	endeavor	in	which	he
would	 be	 responsible	 for	 his	 success	 or	 failure.	 This	 innate	 perspective	 is	 a
characteristic	of	winning	traders.	Successful	traders	take	responsibility	for	their


own	mistakes	and	losses.	Losing	traders	invariably	will	blame	their	outcome	on
someone	or	something	else.

**44.	The	Two	Sides	of	Patience**
Markets	will	tend	to	reward	traits	that	are	difficult	to	maintain.	Patience	is	hard.
It	 requires	 overcoming	 our	 natural	 instincts	 and	 desires.	 It	 is	 a	 trait	 I	 have
repeatedly	 found	 in	 great	 traders.	 There	 are	 two	 aspects	 of	 patience	 that	 are
critical	to	market	success.

```
Patience	to	wait	for	the	right	trade —Trading	opportunities	are	sporadic.
Most	traders	will	find	it	difficult	to	wait	for	trades	that	fit	their	criteria	for
attractive	opportunities	and	will	give	in	to	the	temptation	of	taking	marginal
trades	in	between.	Taking	such	suboptimal	trades	will	have	two	negative
consequences.	First,	they	will	tend	to	result	in	losses	on	balance.	Second,
they	will	dilute	attention	away	from	true	trade	opportunities.	Even	worse,
the	destabilizing	impact	of	a	suboptimal	trade	that	results	in	a	large	loss
could	cause	a	trader	to	miss	a	major	profit	opportunity.	See,	for	example,
Bargh’s	missed	trade	described	in	#29.
Sall	is	the	epitome	of	a	trader	who	has	the	patience	to	wait	for	the	right
trade	as	is	succinctly	reflected	by	his	self-description:	“My	style	has
often	 been	 referred	 to	 that	 of	 a	 sniper.	 I	 am	 in	 a	 constant	 state	 of
readiness	waiting	for	that	perfect	shot.”	Sall	maintains	that	executing
his	 most	 profitable	 trades	 was	 the	 easy	 part.	 The	 difficult	 part	 was
waiting	 for	 the	 optimal	 profit	 opportunities	 and	 avoiding	 marginal
trades	that,	in	his	words,	“waste	mental	and	financial	capital.”
Patience	to	stay	with	a	good	trade —Patience	is	also	required	to	stay	with
good	 trades.	 When	 a	 trade	 is	 profitable,	 it	 is	 tempting	 to	 liquidate	 the
position	 prematurely	 out	 of	 fear	 that	 the	 market	 might	 take	 those	 open
profits	away.	Shapiro	learned	the	power	of	patience	in	staying	with	a	good
trade	when	circumstances	involuntarily	forced	him	into	this	favorable	trait.
At	the	time,	he	was	taking	a	multi-week	vacation	in	Africa,	and	he	knew	the
unavailability	 of	 communication	 facilities	 would	 make	 it	 impossible	 to
check	on	or	trade	the	markets.	Shapiro	provided	his	broker	with	stop-loss
instructions	 and	 didn’t	 see	 his	 account	 again	 until	 he	 returned.	 He
discovered	that	he	made	far	more	money	by	being	away	on	vacation	than	he
ever	 made	 actively	 trading	 his	 account.	 This	 lesson	 stuck,	 as	 the
methodology	 he	 eventually	 developed	 allowed	 for	 staying	 with	 positions
```

```
for	months	if	warranted	by	the	relevant	conditions.
```
**45.	The	Internal	Game	of	Trading**
Sall	believes,	“Your	state	of	mind	is	the	most	critical	factor	to	trading	success
once	you	have	your	methodology	down.”	For	Sall,	the	right	mindset	requires
being	 calm	 and	 focused.	 He	 will	 mentally	 prepare	 for	 an	 anticipated	 trading
event	by	using	breathwork	and	meditation	to	achieve	what	he	calls	a	“deep	now”
state.	Through	keeping	a	journal	and	charting	the	connection	between	emotions
and	losses,	Sall	has	learned	the	importance	of	shifting	any	negative	mindset	and
identifying	emotions	that	could	cause	him	to	self-sabotage	trades.

Bargh	credits	Sall	with	helping	him	appreciate	that	having	a	good	mindset	was
critical	to	trading	well.	Similar	to	Sall,	Bargh	seeks	to	trade	from	a	calm	state
free	 of	 any	 inner	 conflict.	 He	 maintains	 a	 daily	 spreadsheet	 that	 monitors	 a
variety	of	emotional	factors	(e.g.,	ego,	fear	of	missing	out,	happiness	rating,	etc.)
alongside	with	trading	actions.	Bargh	uses	his	feelings	as	an	input	to	his	trading.
If	Bargh	feels	his	emotional	state	is	not	conducive	to	good	trading,	he	will	take	a
break	until	his	mindset	is	back	in	the	right	place.	Bargh	says,	“Mental	capital	is
the	most	critical	aspect	of	trading.	What	matters	most	is	how	you	respond	when
you	 make	 a	 mistake,	 miss	 a	 trade,	 or	 take	 a	 significant	 loss.	 If	 you	 respond
poorly,	you	will	just	make	more	mistakes.”

**46.	Successful	Traders	Love	What	They	Do**
Reading	 these	 interviews,	 you	 should	 have	 been	 struck	 by	 how	 many	 of	 the
traders	talked	about	their	love	of	trading.	Some	examples:

```
Dhaliwal	used	a	gamelike	analogy	to	describe	trading:	“To	me,	playing	the
markets	is	like	a	never-ending	chess	game.	It’s	the	most	exciting	game	you
can	play.”
Camillo	 described	 the	 joy	 he	 finds	 in	 identifying	 trade	 ideas:	 “The	 four
hours	 I	 spend	 every	 night	 doing	 my	 analysis	 is	 something	 that	 I	 love.	 I
never	know	when	I’m	going	to	hit	on	that	thing	that	will	take	me	down	the
path	 to	 my	 next	 big	 trade.	 It’s	 the	 same	 feeling	 I	 had	 as	 a	 kid	 going	 to
garage	sales.”
Netto	explained	his	success,	saying,	“I	am	successful	because	Monday	is
my	favorite	day	of	the	week.	When	you	love	what	you	do,	you’re	going	to
be	successful.”
Shapiro	went	through	depression	during	a	period	when	he	stopped	trading,
```

```
even	though	everything	in	his	personal	life	seemed	to	be	going	well.	When
I	asked	Shapiro	how	he	finally	figured	out	what	was	causing	his	depression,
he	replied,	“It	was	obvious.	I	loved	trading.”
Sall	 recalled	 the	 origin	 of	 his	 passion	 for	 trading:	 “[The	 University	 of
Reading]	had	a	simulated	trading	room,	which	was	my	first	exposure	to
markets	and	trading,	and	I	fell	in	love	with	it.”
Kean	explained	why	a	love	of	trading	is	an	essential	trait	for	a	trader:	“You
need	to	love	trading	so	that	you	can	get	through	the	tough	times.”
Brandt’s	reaction	upon	first	seeing	the	traders	in	the	commodity	pits	was,
“Whoa!	I	want	to	do	this.”	Brandt’s	passion	for	trading	also	comes	across	in
his	description	of	his	early	days	when	he	had	a	virtual	compulsion	to	trade
—an	 enthusiasm	 that	 lasted	 for	 well	 over	 a	 decade.	 His	 love	 of	 trading
eventually	 faded,	 and	 after	 14	 years,	 he	 abandoned	 his	 trading	 career.
Speaking	of	that	time,	he	says,	“The	fun	of	trading	had	left	me	at	that	point.
Trading	had	become	drudgery.”	After	an	11-year	hiatus,	the	compulsion	to
trade	returned,	leading	to	a	second	successful	trading	career,	13	years	and
counting.
```
If	you	want	to	trade,	your	odds	for	success	will	be	significantly	enhanced	if	you
are	motivated	by	a	genuine	love	of	the	endeavor.


# Epilogue

# TO	recast	 an	 old	 joke,	 two	 congregants	 at	 a	 synagogue	 have	 had	 the	 same

running	argument	for	years.	Dave	contends	that	markets	are	efficient	and	that	it
is	impossible	for	anyone	to	beat	the	markets	other	than	by	chance.	Sam	asserts
that	 trading	 opportunities	 exist,	 and	 market	 outperformance	 is	 achievable.
Finally,	after	years	of	fruitless	bickering,	they	agree	to	let	the	rabbi	decide	who	is
right.

They	arrange	to	meet	with	the	rabbi,	explaining	they	would	like	him	to	settle	a
dispute.	When	they	arrive	at	the	rabbi’s	home,	he	tells	them	he	will	speak	with
them	one	at	a	time	in	his	office.	Dave	enters	the	rabbi’s	office	first.

“I	hope	you	don’t	mind	my	wife	being	here,”	the	rabbi	says,	“but	she	takes	notes
for	me.”

Dave	assures	the	rabbi	that	is	fine	and	begins	to	explain	his	side	of	the	argument.
“I	believe	that	the	markets	are	efficient—a	contention	supported	by	thousands	of
academic	 papers.	 And	 it	 is	 not	 just	 a	 theoretical	 argument.	 Empirical	 studies
repeatedly	demonstrate	that	individual	investors	who	make	timing	decisions	do
significantly	worse	than	passive	index	funds.	Even	professional	managers,	on


average,	 consistently	 do	 worse	 than	 the	 market.	 In	 light	 of	 all	 this	 evidence,
trading	 is	 a	 fool’s	 game.	 People	 would	 be	 much	 better	 off	 just	 putting	 their
money	in	index	funds.”

The	rabbi,	who	has	been	listening	intently,	simply	says,	“You’re	right.”

Dave	smiles	smugly,	quite	content	with	the	conversation	outcome,	and	leaves	the
rabbi’s	office.

Sam	walks	in	next.	After	the	same	preliminary	formalities,	he	presents	his	side
of	the	argument.	He	begins	with	a	lengthy	explanation	of	the	myriad	flaws	in	the

efficient	market	hypothesis.^22 	He	then	says,	“Also,	rabbi,	you	know	that	I	earn
my	 living	 as	 a	 trader.	 I	 have	 a	 nice	 home.	 My	 family	 is	 well	 cared	 for.	 My
generous	annual	contributions	to	the	synagogue	come	from	my	trading	profits.
Clearly,	it	is	entirely	possible	to	profit	handsomely	from	trading.”

The	rabbi,	who	has	paid	close	attention,	replies,	“You’re	right.”

Sam	smiles	with	satisfaction	and	walks	out	of	the	rabbi’s	office.

Once	they	are	alone,	the	rabbi’s	wife	turns	to	him	and	says,	“Dearest	husband,	I
know	you	are	a	wise	man,	but	how	can	they	possibly	both	be	right?”

“You’re	right,”	replies	the	rabbi.

Except,	the	rabbi’s	wife	is	not	right.	Both	Dave	and	Sam	are	right	but	in	different
contexts.	The	world	of	traders	(or	investors)	can	be	divided	into	two	categories:
those	 who	 possess	 a	 methodology	 with	 an	 edge	 and	 those	 who	 do	 not.	 The
second	category	is	far	larger	than	the	first.	Market	participants	who	do	not	have
any	special	skill	in	trading	or	investing—a	group	that	includes	most	people—
would	be	better	off	investing	in	index	funds	than	in	trying	to	make	their	own
market	decisions.	So,	ironically,	although	I	do	not	believe	the	efficient	market
hypothesis	is	valid,	I	think	most	people	would	be	best	off	behaving	as	if	the
theory	were	entirely	accurate—a	conclusion	that	would	support	the	idea	of	index
investing.	This	is	the	context	in	which	Dave	is	right.

However,	 there	 is	 a	 big	 difference	 between	 difficult	 and	 impossible.	 The
magnitude	by	which	the	traders	in	this	book	outperformed	market	benchmarks
over	long	periods	(typically,	decade-plus)	cannot	simply	be	explained	away	as
“luck.”	This	is	the	context	in	which	Sam	is	right.

If	there	is	one	message	in	this	book	about	the	possibility	of	trading	success,	it	is:
It	 can	 be	 done!	 However,	 it	 is	 not	 a	 goal	 within	 reach	 of	 most	 people.
Succeeding	as	a	trader	requires	some	combination	of	hard	work,	innate	skill,	and
beneficial	 psychological	 traits	 (e.g.,	 patience,	 discipline,	 etc.).	 For	 the	 small


minority	 of	 market	 participants	 who	 can	 develop	 a	 methodology	 with	 a
demonstrated	 market	 edge	 and	 combine	 it	 with	 rigorous	 risk	 management,
trading	success	is	an	achievable,	albeit	challenging,	goal.

22 	An	adequate	discussion	of	the	deficiencies	in	the	efficient	market	hypothesis	is	far	too	long	to	present
here.	Interested	readers	should	refer	to	Chapter	2	in	my	book	 _Market	Sense	and	Nonsense_.


# Appendix	1:	Understanding	the	Futures	Markets^23

## What	Are	Futures?

# THE	essence	of	a	futures	market	is	in	its	name:	Trading	involves	a	commodity	or

financial	instrument	for	a	future	delivery	date,	as	opposed	to	the	present	time.
Thus,	if	a	cotton	farmer	wished	to	make	a	current	sale,	he	would	sell	his	crop	in
the	local	cash	market.	However,	if	the	same	farmer	wanted	to	lock	in	a	price	for
an	anticipated	future	sale	(e.g.,	the	marketing	of	a	still	unharvested	crop),	he
would	have	two	options.	He	could	locate	an	interested	buyer	and	negotiate	a
contract	specifying	the	price	and	other	details	(quantity,	quality,	delivery	time,
location,	 etc.).	 Alternatively,	 he	 could	 sell	 futures,	 which	 provide	 multiple
attributes.

## Advantages	of	Futures

Some	of	the	major	advantages	of	futures	markets	for	the	hedger	are:

```
1 .	The	futures	contract	is	standardized;	hence,	the	farmer	does	not	have	to	find
a	specific	buyer.
2 .	The	transaction	can	be	executed	virtually	instantaneously	online.
3 .	The	cost	of	the	trade	(commissions)	is	minimal	compared	with	the	cost	of
an	individualized	forward	contract.
4 .	The	farmer	can	offset	his	sale	at	any	time	between	the	original	transaction
date	and	the	final	trading	day	of	the	contract.
5 .	The	futures	contract	is	guaranteed	by	the	exchange.
```
While	hedgers,	such	as	the	aforementioned	cotton	farmer,	participate	in	futures
markets	to	reduce	the	risk	of	an	adverse	price	move,	traders	participate	in	an
effort	to	profit	from	anticipated	price	changes.	In	fact,	most	traders	will	prefer
the	 futures	 markets	 over	 their	 cash	 counterparts	 for	 a	 variety	 of	 reasons	 (a
number	of	which	are	analogous	to	the	advantages	just	listed	for	hedgers):


1 .	 **Standardized	contracts** —Futures	contracts	are	standardized	(in	terms	of
quantity	and	quality);	thus,	the	trader	does	not	have	to	find	a	specific	buyer
or	seller	in	order	to	initiate	or	liquidate	a	position.

2 .	 **Liquidity** —All	of	the	major	futures	markets	provide	excellent	liquidity.

3 .	 **Ease	of	going	short** —The	futures	markets	allow	equal	ease	of	going	short
as	well	as	long.	For	example,	the	short	seller	in	the	stock	market	needs	to
first	borrow	the	stock,	which	is	not	always	possible,	and	must	wait	for	an
uptick	before	initiating	a	position.	No	such	impediments	exist	in	the	futures
markets.

4 .	 **Leverage** —The	 futures	 markets	 offer	 tremendous	 leverage.	 Roughly
speaking,	initial	margin	requirements	are	usually	equal	to	5%–10%	of	the
contract	 value.	 (The	 use	 of	 the	 term	 margin	 in	 the	 futures	 market	 is
unfortunate	because	it	leads	to	tremendous	confusion	with	the	concept	of
margins	 in	 stocks.	 In	 the	 futures	 markets,	 margins	 do	 not	 imply	 partial
payments,	since	no	actual	physical	transaction	occurs	until	the	expiration
date;	 rather,	 margins	 are	 basically	 good-faith	 deposits.)	 Although	 high
leverage	is	one	of	the	attributes	of	futures	markets	for	traders,	it	should	be
emphasized	that	leverage	is	a	two-edged	sword.	The	undisciplined	use	of
leverage	is	the	single	most	important	reason	why	most	traders	lose	money
in	the	futures	markets.	In	general,	futures	prices	are	no	more	volatile	than
the	underlying	cash	prices	or,	for	that	matter,	most	stocks.	The	high-risk
reputation	of	futures	is	largely	a	consequence	of	the	leverage	factor.

5 .	 **Low	 transaction	 costs** —Futures	 markets	 provide	 very	 low	 transaction
costs.	For	example,	it	is	far	less	expensive	for	a	stock	portfolio	manager	to
reduce	market	exposure	by	selling	the	equivalent	dollar	amount	of	stock
index	futures	contracts	than	by	selling	individual	stocks.

6 .	 **Ease	of	offset** —A	futures	position	can	be	offset	at	any	time	during	market
hours,	 providing	 prices	 are	 not	 locked	 at	 limit-up	 or	 limit-down.	 (Some
futures	markets	specify	daily	maximum	price	changes.	In	cases	in	which
free	market	forces	would	normally	seek	an	equilibrium	price	outside	the
range	of	boundaries	implied	by	price	limits,	the	market	will	simply	move	to
the	limit	and	virtually	cease	to	trade.)

7 .	 **Guaranteed	 by	 exchange** —The	 futures	 trader	 does	 not	 have	 to	 be
concerned	about	the	financial	stability	of	the	person	on	the	other	side	of	the
trade.	The	exchange	clearing	house	guarantees	all	futures	transactions.


## Trading	Futures

The	trader	seeks	to	profit	by	anticipating	price	changes.	For	example,	if	the	price
of	 December	 gold	 is	 $1,550/oz,	 a	 trader	 who	 expects	 the	 price	 to	 rise	 above
$1,650/oz	will	go	long.	The	trader	has	no	intention	of	actually	taking	delivery	of
the	 gold	 in	 December.	 Right	 or	 wrong,	 the	 trader	 will	 offset	 the	 position
sometime	before	expiration.	For	example,	if	the	price	rises	to	$1,675	and	the
trader	decides	to	take	profits,	the	gain	on	the	trade	will	be	$12,500	per	contract
(100	oz	×	$125/oz).	If,	on	the	other	hand,	the	trader’s	forecast	is	wrong	and
prices	decline	to	$1,475/oz,	with	the	expiration	date	drawing	near,	the	trader	has
little	choice	but	to	liquidate.	In	this	situation,	the	loss	would	be	equal	to	$7,500
per	 contract.	 Note	 the	 trader	 would	 not	 take	 delivery	 even	 given	 a	 desire	 to
maintain	 the	 long	 gold	 position.	 In	 this	 case,	 the	 trader	 would	 liquidate	 the
December	contract	and	simultaneously	go	long	in	a	more	forward	contract.	(This
type	of	transaction	is	called	a _	rollover_ 	and	would	be	implemented	with	a _	spread_
order.)	 Traders	 should	 always	 avoid	 taking	 delivery,	 since	 it	 can	 result	 in
substantial	extra	costs	without	any	compensating	benefits.

Novice	traders	should	caution	against	the	securities-based	bias	of	trading	only
from	the	long	side.	In	futures	trading,	there	is	no	distinction	between	going	short

and	going	long.^24 	Since	prices	can	go	down	as	well	as	up,	the	trader	who	takes
only	 long	 positions	 will	 eliminate	 approximately	 half	 the	 potential	 trading
opportunities.	Also,	it	should	be	noted	that	futures	often	command	a	premium	to
current	 prices;	 consequently,	 the	 inflation	 argument	 for	 a	 long-side	 bias	 is
frequently	erroneous.

The	successful	trader	must	employ	some	method	for	forecasting	prices.	The	two
basic	analytical	approaches	are:

```
1 .	 Technical	 Analysis. The	 technical	 analyst	 bases	 projections	 on	 non-
economic	data.	Price	data	are	by	far	the	most	important—and	often	only—
input	in	technical	analysis.	The	basic	assumption	of	technical	analysis	is
that	 prices	 exhibit	 repetitive	 patterns	 and	 that	 the	 recognition	 of	 these
patterns	 can	 be	 used	 to	 identify	 trading	 opportunities.	 Technical	 analysis
can	also	include	other	data,	such	as	volume,	open	interest,	and	sentiment
measures.
2 .	 Fundamental	Analysis. 	The	fundamental	analyst	uses	economic	data	(e.g.,
production,	 consumption,	 exports)	 to	 forecast	 prices.	 In	 essence,	 the
```

```
fundamentalist	 seeks	 to	 uncover	 trading	 opportunities	 by	 identifying
potential	transitions	to	significantly	more	ample	or	tighter	supply-demand
balances.	For	financial	futures,	fundamental	inputs	will	include	items	such
as	central	bank	policy,	inflation	statistics,	employment	data,	etc.
```
Technical	 and	 fundamental	 analysis	 are	 not	 mutually	 exclusive	 approaches.
Many	 traders	 use	 both	 in	 the	 decision-making	 process	 or	 as	 components	 of
automated	trading	systems.

## Delivery

Shorts	who	maintain	their	positions	in	deliverable	future	contracts	after	the	last
trading	day	are	obligated	to	deliver	the	given	commodity	or	financial	instrument
against	the	contract.	Similarly,	longs	who	maintain	their	positions	after	the	last
trading	day	must	accept	delivery.	In	futures	markets,	the	number	of	open	long
contracts	is	always	equal	to	the	number	of	open	short	contracts.	Most	traders
have	no	intention	of	making	or	accepting	delivery,	and	hence	will	offset	their
positions	before	the	last	trading	day.	It	has	been	estimated	that	fewer	than	3%	of
open	 contracts	 actually	 result	 in	 delivery.	 Some	 futures	 contracts	 (e.g.,	 stock
indexes,	Eurodollar)	use	a	 _cash	settlement_ 	process	whereby	outstanding	long	and
short	positions	are	offset	at	the	prevailing	price	level	at	expiration	instead	of
being	physically	delivered.

## The	Scope	of	Futures	Markets

Until	 the	 early	 1970s,	 futures	 markets	 were	 restricted	 to	 commodities	 (e.g.,
wheat,	sugar,	copper,	cattle).	Since	that	time,	the	futures	area	has	expanded	to
incorporate	additional	market	sectors,	most	significantly	stock	indexes,	interest
rates,	 and	 currencies	 (foreign	 exchange).	 The	 same	 basic	 principles	 apply	 to
these	 financial	 futures	 markets.	 Trading	 quotes	 represent	 prices	 for	 a	 future
expiration	 date	 rather	 than	 current	 market	 prices.	 For	 example,	 the	 quote	 for
December	10-year	T-notes	implies	a	specific	price	for	a	$100,000,	10-year	US
Treasury	Note	to	be	delivered	in	December.	Financial	markets	have	experienced
spectacular	growth	since	their	introduction,	and	today	trading	volume	in	these
contracts	 dwarfs	 that	 in	 commodities.	 Nevertheless,	 futures	 markets	 are	 still
commonly,	 albeit	 erroneously,	 referred	 to	 as	 commodity	 markets,	 and	 these
terms	are	synonymous.

Since	by	their	very	structure	futures	are	closely	tied	to	their	underlying	markets
(the	 activity	 of	 arbitrageurs	 assures	 that	 deviations	 are	 relatively	 minor	 and


short-lived),	 price	 moves	 in	 futures	 will	 very	 closely	 parallel	 those	 in	 the
corresponding	cash	markets.	Keeping	in	mind	that	the	majority	of	futures	trading
activity	 is	 concentrated	 in	 financial	 instruments,	 many	 futures	 traders	 are,	 in
reality,	traders	in	stocks,	bonds,	and	currencies.	In	this	context,	the	comments	of
futures	traders	interviewed	in	this	book	have	direct	relevance	even	to	investors
who	have	never	ventured	beyond	stocks	and	bonds.

23 	Sections	of	this	appendix	have	been	adapted	from	Jack	D.	Schwager,	 _A	Complete	Guide	to	the	Futures
Market_ 	(New	Jersey,	John	Wiley	and	Sons,	Inc.,	2017)	and	Jack	D.	Schwager,	 _Market	Wizards_ 	(New	Jersey,
John	Wiley	and	Sons,	Inc.,	2012).
24 	Some	beginners	are	confused	about	how	it	is	possible	for	a	trader	to	sell	a	commodity	he	does	not
own.The	 key	 to	 the	 answer	 lies	 in	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 trader	 is	 selling	 a	 _futures_ contract,	 not	 the	 cash
commodity.	 Even	 though	 the	 trader	 who	 stays	 short	 past	 the	 last	 trading	 day	 must	 acquire	 the	 actual
commodity	to	fulfill	his	contractual	obligation,	there	is	no	need	for	him	to	own	the	commodity	before	that
time.	The	short	sale	is	simply	a	bet	that	prices	will	go	down	before	the	last	trading	day.	Right	or	wrong,	the
trader	will	offset	his	short	position	before	the	last	trading	day,	eliminating	any	need	for	actual	ownership	of
the	commodity.


# Appendix	2:	Performance	Metrics

# MANY	traders	and	investors	make	the	mistake	of	focusing	almost	exclusively	on

returns.	This	emphasis	is	a	mistake	because	return	levels	only	have	meaning	in
context	of	the	risk	undertaken	to	achieve	those	returns.	Do	you	want	to	double
your	returns?	Easy—just	double	the	size	of	all	your	trades.	Does	this	make	you	a
better	 trader?	 Of	 course	 not—because	 you	 will	 also	 be	 doubling	 the	 risk.
Focusing	on	returns	only	is	as	absurd	as	assuming	that	higher	returns	due	solely
to	larger	position	sizing	is	indicative	of	better	performance.	For	this	reason,	I
focus	on	return/risk	rather	than	return	in	evaluating	and	comparing	traders	and
managers.	 The	 return	 level	 is	 still	 relevant,	 though,	 because	 it	 doesn’t	 make
sense	 to	 consider	 a	 low	 return	 track	 record	 as	 being	 superior	 even	 if	 the
return/risk	is	very	high.

_The	following	metrics	are	referenced	in	the	trader	chapters	in	this	book._

## Average	Annual	Compounded	Return

This	value	is	the	return	level	that,	when	compounded	annually,	will	yield	the
cumulative	return.	Although	I	pay	more	attention	to	the	return/risk	metrics	than
return,	 a	 performance	 record	 can	 have	 superior	 return/risk	 values	 and	 an
unacceptably	 low	 return	 level.	 Therefore,	 it	 is	 still	 necessary	 to	 check	 return
alone.

## The	Sharpe	Ratio

The	 Sharpe	 ratio	 is	 the	 most	 widely	 used	 risk-adjusted	 return	 measure.	 The
Sharpe	 ratio	 is	 defined	 as	 the	 average	 _excess	return_ divided	 by	 the	 standard
deviation.	Excess	return	is	the	return	above	the	risk-free	return	(e.g.,	T-bill	rate).
For	example,	if	the	average	return	is	8%	per	year	and	the	T-bill	rate	is	3%,	the
excess	 return	 would	 be	 5%.	 The	 standard	 deviation	 is	 a	 measure	 of	 the
variability	of	return.	In	essence,	the	Sharpe	ratio	is	the	average	excess	return
normalized	by	the	volatility	of	returns.

There	are	two	basic	problems	with	the	Sharpe	ratio:

```
1 .	 The	 return	 measure	 is	 based	 on	 average	 rather	 than	 compounded
```

```
return. 	The	return	an	investor	realizes	is	the	compounded	return,	not	the
average	return.	The	more	volatile	the	return	series,	the	more	the	average
return	will	deviate	from	the	actual	(i.e.,	compounded)	return.	For	example,
a	two-year	period	with	a	50%	gain	in	one	year	and	a	50%	loss	in	the	other
would	represent	a	0%	average	return,	but	the	investor	would	actually	realize
a	25%	loss	(150%	×	50%	=	75%).	The	average	annual	compounded	return
of	-13.4%,	however,	would	reflect	the	reality	(86.6%	×	86.6%	=	75%).
2 .	 The	Sharpe	ratio	does	not	distinguish	between	upside	and	downside
volatility. The	 risk	 measure	 inherent	 in	 the	 Sharpe	 ratio—the	 standard
deviation—does	not	reflect	the	way	most	investors	perceive	risk.	Traders
and	investors	care	about	loss,	not	volatility.	They	are	averse	to	downside
volatility	but	actually	like	upside	volatility.	I	have	yet	to	meet	an	investor
who	complained	because	his	manager	made	too	much	money	in	a	month.
The	 standard	 deviation,	 and	 by	 inference	 the	 Sharpe	 ratio,	 however,	 is
indifferent	between	upside	and	downside	volatility.	This	characteristic	of
the	Sharpe	ratio	can	result	in	rankings	that	would	contradict	most	people’s
perceptions	and	preferences.^25
```
## Sortino	Ratio

The	Sortino	ratio	addresses	both	the	problems	cited	for	the	Sharpe	ratio.	First,	it
uses	the	compounded	return,	which	represents	the	actual	realized	return	over	any
period,	 instead	 of	 the	 arithmetic	 return.	 Second,	 and	 most	 importantly,	 the
Sortino	ratio	focuses	on	defining	risk	in	terms	of	the	downside	deviation,	which
is	calculated	using	only	returns	below	a	specified	Minimum	Acceptable	Return
(MAR).	In	contrast,	the	standard	deviation,	used	in	the	Sharpe	ratio,	includes	all
deviations,	 upside	 as	 well	 as	 downside.	 The	 Sortino	 ratio	 is	 defined	 as	 the
compounded	return	in	excess	of	the	MAR	divided	by	the	downside	deviation.
The	MAR	in	the	Sortino	ratio	can	be	set	to	any	level,	but	one	of	the	following
three	definitions	are	typically	used	for	the	MAR:

```
1 .	 Zero —Deviations	 are	 calculated	 for	 all	 negative	 returns	 (the	 definition
assumed	in	this	book).
2 .	 Risk-free	Return —Deviations	are	calculated	for	all	returns	below	the	risk-
free	return.
3 .	 Average	 Return —Deviations	 are	 calculated	 for	 all	 returns	 below	 the
```

```
average	 of	 the	 series	 being	 analyzed.	 This	 formulation	 is	 closest	 to	 the
standard	 deviation,	 but	 only	 considers	 deviations	 for	 the	 lower	 half	 of
returns.
```
Because	it	distinguishes	between	upside	and	downside	deviations,	the	Sortino
ratio	comes	closer	to	reflecting	most	people’s	performance	preferences	than	does
the	Sharpe	ratio,	and,	in	this	sense,	it	is	a	better	tool	for	comparing	traders.	But
the	Sortino	ratio	cannot	be	directly	compared	with	the	Sharpe	ratio	for	reasons
explained	in	the	next	section.

## Adjusted 	Sortino	Ratio

Frequently,	the	fact	that	a	manager	has	a	higher	Sortino	ratio	than	Sharpe	ratio	is
cited	 as	 evidence	 that	 returns	 are	 positively	 skewed—a	 tendency	 for	 larger
deviations	 on	 the	 upside	 than	 on	 the	 downside.	 This	 type	 of	 comparison	 and
inference	 is	 incorrect.	 The	 Sortino	 and	 Sharpe	 ratios	 cannot	 be	 directly
compared.	As	formulated,	the	Sortino	ratio	will	almost	invariably	be	higher	than
the	Sharpe	ratio,	 _even	for	managers	whose	worst	losses	tend	to	be	larger	than
their	best	gains_ .	The	reason	for	the	upward	bias	in	the	Sortino	ratio	(as	compared
with	the	Sharpe	ratio)	is	that	it	calculates	deviations	for	only	a	portion	of	returns
—those	returns	below	the	MAR—but	uses	a	divisor	based	on	the	number	of	 _all_
returns	to	calculate	the	downside	deviation.

The	 _adjusted_ Sortino	 ratio	 is	 equal	 to	 the	 Sortino	 ratio/√2.	 The	 reason	 for
dividing	 by	 √2	 is	 explained	 in	 the	 technical	 note	 below.	 I	 much	 prefer	 the
adjusted	 Sortino	 ratio	 to	 the	 Sharpe	 ratio	 because	 it	 only	 penalizes	 downside
volatility,	 whereas	 the	 risk	 measure	 of	 the	 Sharpe	 ratio	 doesn’t	 distinguish
between	upside	and	downside	volatility.

_Technical	Note:_ 	Since	the	loss	measure	in	the	Sortino	ratio	is	based	on	summing
a	smaller	number	of	deviations	(i.e.,	only	the	deviations	of	losing	returns),	the
Sortino	 ratio	 will	 invariably	 be	 higher	 than	 the	 Sharpe	 ratio.	 To	 allow	 for
comparing	the	Sortino	ratio	to	the	Sharpe	ratio,	we	multiply	the	risk	measure	of
the	Sortino	ratio	by	the	square	root	of	2	(which	is	equivalent	to	dividing	the
Sortino	ratio	by	the	square	root	of	2).	Multiplying	the	risk	measure	of	the	Sortino
ratio	by	the	square	root	of	2	will	equalize	the	risk	measures	of	the	Sharpe	and
Sortino	 ratios	 when	 upside	 and	 downside	 deviations	 are	 equal,	 which	 seems
appropriate.	 The	 adjusted	 version	 of	 the	 Sortino	 ratio	 allows	 for	 direct
comparisons	 of	 the	 Sharpe	 and	 Sortino	 ratios.	 Generally	 speaking,	 a	 higher
adjusted	Sortino	ratio	implies	that	the	distribution	of	returns	is	right-skewed	(a


greater	 tendency	 for	 large	 gains	 than	 large	 losses).	 And,	 similarly,	 a	 lower
adjusted	Sortino	ratio	implies	returns	are	left-skewed	(a	greater	propensity	for
large	losses	than	large	gains).

## Gain	to	Pain	Ratio

The	Gain	to	Pain	ratio	(GPR)	is	the	sum	of	all	monthly	returns	divided	by	the

absolute	value	of	the	sum	of	all	monthly	losses.^26 	This	performance	measure
indicates	 the	 ratio	 of	 cumulative	 _net_ gain	 to	 the	 cumulative	 loss	 realized	 to
achieve	that	gain.	For	example,	a	GPR	of	1.0	would	imply	that,	on	average,	an
investor	has	to	experience	an	equal	amount	of	monthly	losses	to	the	net	amount
gained.	If	the	average	return	per	year	is	12%	(arithmetic	not	compounded),	the
average	amount	of	monthly	losses	per	year	would	also	sum	to	12%.	The	GPR
penalizes	all	losses	in	proportion	to	their	size,	and	upside	volatility	is	beneficial
since	it	impacts	only	the	return	portion	of	the	ratio.

A	key	difference	between	the	GPR	and	measures	such	as	the	Sharpe	ratio	and	the
Sortino	ratio	is	that	the	GPR	will	be	indifferent	between	five	2%	losses	and	one
10%	loss,	whereas	the	other	ratios	discussed	so	far	will	be	impacted	far	more	by
the	single	larger	loss.	This	difference	results	because	the	standard	deviation	and
downside	deviation	calculations	used	for	the	other	ratios	involve	squaring	the
deviation	between	the	reference	return	level	(e.g.,	average,	zero,	risk-free)	and
the	loss.	For	example,	if	the	reference	return	is	0%,	the	squared	deviation	for	one
10%	loss	would	be	five	times	greater	than	the	squared	deviation	for	five	2%

losses	(10^2 	=	100;	5	×	2^2 	=	20).	In	contrast,	in	the	GPR	calculation,	both	cases
will	 add	 10%	 to	 the	 denominator.	 I	 believe	 there	 is	 value	 in	 using	 both	 the
adjusted	Sortino	ratio	and	the	GPR	in	performance	evaluation.

Although	the	GPR	would	typically	be	applied	to	monthly	data,	it	can	also	be
calculated	for	other	time	intervals.	If	daily	data	is	available,	the	GPR	can	provide
a	statistically	very	significant	measure	because	of	the	large	amount	of	sample
data.	The	longer	the	time	frame,	the	higher	the	GPR,	because	many	of	the	losses
visible	on	a	shorter	time	interval	will	be	smoothed	out	over	a	longer	period.	In
my	experience,	on	average,	monthly	GPR	values	tend	to	be	about	six	to	seven
times	as	large	as	the	daily	GPR	for	the	same	trader,	although	this	multiple	can
vary	widely	among	traders.	For	monthly	data,	roughly	speaking,	GPRs	greater
than	1.0	are	very	good,	and	those	above	2.0	are	excellent.	For	daily	data,	the
corresponding	numbers	would	be	approximately	0.15	and	0.30.

25 	In	some	cases,	high	upside	volatility	can	be	indicative	of	a	greater	potential	for	downside	volatility.	In


these	 instances,	 the	 Sharpe	 ratio	 will	 be	 an	 appropriate	 measure.	 The	 Sharpe	 ratio,	 however,	 will	 be
particularly	 misleading	 in	 evaluating	 strategies	 designed	 to	 achieve	 sporadic	 large	 gains,	 while	 strictly
controlling	downside	risk	(that	is,	right-skewed	strategies).
26 	The	Gain	to	Pain	Ratio	(GPR)	is	a	performance	statistic	I	have	been	using	for	many	years.	I	am	not
aware	of	any	prior	use	of	this	statistic,	although	the	term	is	sometimes	used	as	a	generic	reference	for
return/risk	measures	or	a	return/drawdown	measure.	The	GPR	is	similar	to	the	“profit	factor,”	which	is	a
commonly	 used	 statistic	 in	 evaluating	 trading	 systems.	 The	 profit	 factor	 is	 defined	 as	 the	 sum	 of	 all
profitable	trades	divided	by	the	absolute	value	of	the	sum	of	all	losing	trades.	The	profit	factor	is	applied	to
trades,	whereas	the	GPR	is	applied	to	interval	(e.g.,	monthly)	returns.	Algebraically,	it	can	easily	be	shown
that	if	the	profit	factor	calculation	were	applied	to	monthly	returns,	the	profit	factor	would	equal	GPR+1
and	would	provide	the	same	performance	ordering	as	the	GPR.	For	quantitatively	oriented	readers	familiar
with	the	Omega	function,	note	that	the	Omega	function	evaluated	at	zero	is	also	equal	to	GPR+1.
